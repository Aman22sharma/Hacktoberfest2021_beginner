# Python For Loop : the for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence(list,tuple string) or other iterable objects.

# iterating over a sequence is called traversal


#for loops with list
a=['apple','mango','banana','orange']
for name in a:
    print(name *2)  # when a string is multiplied to any integer it gets itself repeated that many times
