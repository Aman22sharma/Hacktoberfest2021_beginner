most impoantly, building a basic safety net for the deprived section of our society. We have demonstrated what all can be achieved by a commied and decisive leadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.  In the next ve years, we promise to create growth oppounities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while retaining our civilisational roots. The physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last ve years. We have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electried 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new airpos and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of National Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airpos, modernize 400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks. In order to achieve our long-term goals, we must rst secure our country against internal and external aggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our security apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our foreign policy, were necessary, in order to tackle the problem of global terrorism. Thus, we intend to increase the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the “Make in India in Defence” initiative to fuher indigenise our defense equipment. Since our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and lowing tax rates. An impoant aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and resolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to signicantly increase the capacity of the legal system within ve years in panership/co-ordination with the judiciary. In the last ve years, we re-imposed macro-economic stability while building lasting frameworks for economic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, ination-targeting, nationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These eos have not only changed the business culture of the country and anchored ination at 4 percent, but have also been internationally recognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will ensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy in future while maintaining macrostability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised, in his very rst speech in Lok Sabha, that this government would work for the welfare of the poorest. In the last ve years, we have created a transparent mechanism for directly delivering basic services to the boom of the pyramid by leveraging Aadhaar, DBT and Jan Dhan accounts. Basic health has been a special focus with large investments made on sanitation (Swachh Bharat), health insurance (Ayushmaan Bharat) and in modern medical facilities. We intend to accelerate the pace of providing access to basic amenities such as housing, electricity, toilet, cooking gas, and health/social security to every poor Indian household, rural and urban, in the next ve years and to bring the percentage of population below the povey line to single digits.  Agriculture employs a large propoion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for farmers, the minimum suppo price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition, we have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating of urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), provided insurance cover to 14 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income suppo for 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next ve years, we will create a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interestfree Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain commied to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if necessary. The cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as impoant as its economic capital. These too need continuous investment and we intend to expand suppo for protecting cultural/linguistic heritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical impoance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both internationally and to the next generation. We reiterate our stand to explore all possibilities within the framework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya. We remain commied to ensuring the benets of constitutional provisions to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. We recently introduced a fuher 10% reservation for the economically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously complete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states. Every society progresses through the empowerment of women, inclusion of minorities and the encouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement. Therefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah Halala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary schools as well as expanding our teiary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of universities and research institutions in order make them world class. For three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This propagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of life in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every eo has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in the management of national assets as well as to bring oenders to book. In the last ve years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By lowering ination and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real cost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a National Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will be a special focus. We will make sure that all UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India have facilities of international standard. We will also identify and promote specic sites of cultural/natural impoance as a national priority (while being sensitive to their preservation). The above summary is based on the vision of Prime Minister Modi to build a technologically modern, entrepreneurial, rules-based economy that is secure from external/internal security threats and simultaneously able to build on its cultural, ecological and social assets.  Nation First The decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national security paradigm of India in the last ve years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following: Our security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exemplied by the Surgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will rmly continue our policy of ‘Zero Tolerance’ against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand to our security forces in combating terrorism. Zero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism 01 Strengthening our Armed Forces - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related equipments and weapons. In order to equip the Armed Forces with modern equipment, we will continue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces. Self-reliance in defence sector - In order to ensure self-reliance in procurement of defence equipment, we have taken several eective steps in the last ve years. For instance, the most modern AK-203 automatic ries are being manufactured at Amethi under our 'Make in India in Defence' initiative. We are commied to focus on 'Make in India in Defence' to enable indigenous production of defence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence sector. National Security 02 03 We have already demonstrated our commitment to the welfare of our veterans with the implementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more eective framework for the reselement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this eo, the Armed Forces will sta planning for the reselement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in accordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, so skills training, nancial suppo for higher education, for housing and for staing an enterprise. Welfare of Soldiers 04 We will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to fuher increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to eectively combat internal security challenges. We will provide assistance to the states to upgrade their police forces through the ‘Scheme for Modernization of Police Forces’. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to enable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be more sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society. Modernization of Police Forces 05 06 We will continue to undeake eective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the Noheastern states. For this, we will fuher strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to strengthen border security (Sma Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement this on all borders. There has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity of some areas due to illegal immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on local people's livelihood and employment. We will expeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we will implement the NRC in a phased manner in other pas of the country. We will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to ensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased paicipation of and benets for border areas in the country’s development and progress. We have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate easier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will fuher ease the movement of goods and people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. Aer completion of all the proposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be conducted through the integrated check-posts. Reinforcing Border Security 09 10 Aer eectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme to provide modern equipment and allocating funds to the states for establishing coastal police stations, establishment of National Commiee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island Information System and National Academy of Coastal Policing, we will continue to take steps for ensuring security of India’s long coastline. Coastal Safety 11 We are commied to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Bill for the protection of individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We will make all eos to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the Noheastern states who have expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the linguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of Noheast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs escaping persecution from India’s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India. Citizenship Amendment Bill 12 We have already taken strong actions to reduce le wing extremism to a very large extent and limited them to small pockets. We are commied to taking necessary and eective steps against le wing extremism to eliminate this menace in the next ve years. In the last ve years, we have focussed on the development of economic and social infrastructure such as roads, mobile towers, schools and medical facilities in the tribal areas aected by le wing extremism and we will continue to make eos in this direction. Combating Le Wing Extremism 13 Ÿ In the last ve years, we have made all necessary eos to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir through decisive actions and a rm policy. We are commied to overcome all obstacles that come in the way of development and provide adequate nancial resources to all the regions of the state. We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Aicle 370. Ÿ We are commied to annulling Aicle 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir. We believe that Aicle 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state. We will take all steps to ensure a safe and peaceful environment for all residents of the state. We will make all eos to ensure the safe return of Kashmiri Pandits and we will provide nancial assistance for the reselement of refugees from West Pakistan, Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) and Chhamb. Jammu & Kashmir- Aicle 370 14 India suppos peace, but the country will not hesitate to take any steps required for national security - Shri Narendra Modi 12 Doubling Farmers’ Income At the very beginning of our current term, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a mission to double farmers’ income. We will make all eos to achieve this goal by 2022. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana to all - We have launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana to ensure nancial suppo to farmers owning land up to 2 hectares. We will fuher expand the coverage of the scheme to all the farmers in the country. Pension for small and marginal farmers - We will launch a pension scheme for all small and marginal farmers in the country so as to ensure social security to them on reaching 60 years of age. ₹25 lakh crore investment in Agri-rural sector - We are commied to making an investment of Rs. 25 lakh crore to improve the productivity of the farm sector.

Voluntary enrollment in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana - Our scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has ensured risk mitigation and provided insurance cover for all farmers. We will make enrolment of farmers under the scheme voluntary. Empowering Farmers through Policies - We will work towards reducing all agricultural impos and institute a predictable expo and impo policy with a built-in mechanism for encouraging expos and discouraging impos. Assurance of Quality Seeds - We will ensure timely availability of improved seeds of promising varieties at aordable rates with doorstep testing facilities. Welfare of Farmers 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 Oilseeds Mission - We will launch a new mission to achieve self-suciency in oil seeds and other agriproducts. Ÿ To enable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an appropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce. We will provide farmers with loans at cheaper rates on the basis of storage receipt of the agri-produce. Warehouse Network across the Country - We will build an ecient storage and transpo mechanism for agriculture produce Ÿ Our Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana highlights our focus on warehousing as a means of increasing farmers’ income. To fuher expand the warehousing infrastructure in the country, we will establish a National Warehousing Grid along National Highways to ensure necessary logistical linkages for warehousing of agricultural produce. Ÿ We will promote chemical-free organic farming in an additional 20 lakh hectare of hilly, tribal and rainfed areas in the next 5 years. Ÿ We will launch a dedicated e-commerce poal to enhance the availability of organic produce to the doorsteps of consumers. Goshalas in the country will be linked to the promotion of organic farming. 11 National Bee-keeping and Honey Mission: We will launch a National Bee-keeping and Honey Mission to ensure additional returns to the farmers. We will double the honey production from the present 11,500 MT by developing infrastructural facilities and providing marketing suppo. We will bring one crore hectares agricultural land under micro-irrigation, this would be supplemented with ‘feigation’ to promote judicious use of feilizers. We have completed work on the long-pending 31 irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and work will soon be completed on the remaining 68 projects in phases up to December 2019. Continuing our eos to developing irrigation, we will fuher expand Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to realize 100% irrigation potential of the country within a dened time-frame. Expanding Irrigation in Mission Mode We recognize the role of cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play in ensuring beer market linkages and oppounities in the agricultural sector and we are commied to suppo and strengthen them. To cater to the needs of big cities we will set up a mechanism of direct marketing of vegetables, fruits, dairy and shery products through farmers’ cooperative organizations so as to ensure beer price return to the farmers. We will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure economies of scale for farmers regarding access to inputs and markets. Cooperatives We will create a mobile app based system for promoting the availability of agri-implements on rental/custom hiring basis. We view solar energy as an additional source of income for farmers and will encourage solar farming on a massive scale so as to enable the ‘Annadaata’(food provider) to become ‘Urja-daata’ (energy provider). We will extensively use technology to ensure a beer knowledge of the market prices of various agroproducts for the benet of farmers. We will enable development of young agri-scientists to take advantage of Aicial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Blockchain technology, Big Data analytics etc. for more predictive and protable precision agriculture. Digitization of Land Records - On the lines of Aadhaar project, we will complete digitization of land records on a mission mode. We will implement second-generation land reforms to ensure title guarantee for the landholder and reduce land-related litigation. We will create a model law for conclusive titling (in consultation with states) promoting title guarantee and title insur ance and work with States to implement this system. Convergence of Agriculture and Technology 12 13 14 15 16 18 17 19 20 21 14 22 We have given utmost impoance to the dairy sector and have established Kamdhenu Aayog for the conservation of indigenous species of cale. We will establish a network of mobile veterinary dispensaries to provide doorstep service to farmers. We will expand the coverage of immunization and eliminate Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis. We will launch a National Feed and Fodder Mission to eliminate the shoage of fodder. We will roll out a model programme for periodic health checkup of all cale and other domestic animals at the district level with the help of veterinary expes from the public and private sector. Animal Husbandry 26 We will promote aquaculture through easy access to credit. We will launch ‘Matsya Sampada Yojana’ with an allocation of Rs. 10,000 crores to ensure availability of storage and marketing tools and infrastructure like ice-boxes, cold storages, ice-plants etc. for small and traditional shermen. We will facilitate farming of sea-weed, pearl as well as ornamental sh to ensure a beer return to the shermen. We will bring all shermen under the ambit of all welfare programmes and social security schemes with expanded coverage for accident insurance. Fisheries - Blue Revolution 23 24 25 27 28 29 15 Gram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of India. As we approach the 150th bih anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Pay resolves to realize his vision of Gram Swaraj by ensuring that everyone has equitable access to resources. As India reaches the dening milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram Swaraj as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi. In line with this vision we promise: On the Path of Gram Swaraj We will launch ‘Jal Jivan Mission’ under which we will introduce a special program, ‘Nal se Jal’ to ensure piped water connection to every household by 2024. We will launch a massive ‘Rural Road Upgradation Programme’ to connect centres of education, healthcare centres, and markets with hinterlands to promote rural growth. We will ensure that every Gram Panchayat is connected through a high speed optical bre network by 2022. Sujal (Drinking Water) Sadak se Samriddhi (Road connectivity) Suchna se Sashaktikaran (Digital connectivity through Bharatnet) We will ensure a pucca house to every family who are either living in a kuchha house or have no access to housing by 2022. Saashray (Housing) We will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste water and reuse of waste water. Swachhata se Sampannata (Swachh Bharat Mission) 16 India as the World’s 3rd Largest Economy 03 Our economic policy has been guided by the principle of lowering the tax rate and improving compliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base, the tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in the recent past, up from 10.1% in 2013-14. This increased revenue has been deployed for benets to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an unprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner – lowering of tax rate thereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance. Tax Policy 04 Goods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue collection, paicularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states have increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simplication of GST process by engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders. Goods and Service Tax 05 We will fuher continue our eos to promote Yoga globally as the world celebrates 21st June as the International Yoga Day. We will promote Yoga as a vital method to achieve physical wellness and spiritual rejuvenation across the globe and will continue to work towards training of Yoga practitioners. We will undeake a rapid expansion of Yoga health hubs, Yoga tourism and research in Yoga. Promoting Yoga Globally While social security net for the poor and farmers will be expanded, we will take up capital investment in the country to a new height. By 2024, we will make capital investment of Rs.100 lakh crore in the infrastructure sector. We recognize that investment driven growth requires cheaper cost of capital. By anchoring ination at 4% and cleaning up our banking system we have created the space for structural reduction in the cost of capital. This will not only help infrastructure investment but investment also in the wider economy. Thus, new India will be built on the basis of investment driven growth. ₹100 lakh crore Investment 06 India was branded as ‘fragile ve’ in 2014. Within ve years, we have turned India into a bright spot that is not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability. We have already become the world’s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top ve. We aspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to make India a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032. When compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of average GDP growth (7.3%) over the last ve years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer ination (4.6%). The consumer ination is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower scal decits and signicantly lower current account decit as a percentage of GDP. Average scal decit as a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14. Reduction in scal decit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost Rs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account decit as a percentage of GDP during this government has been reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14. Roadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy With the aim of developing India into a knowledge based, skill suppoed and technology driven society, we have launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign. A beginning has already been made through our initiatives like Digital India, Staup India and Skill India. To bring in fast and inclusive growth, we have also carried out substantial reforms in the last few years in terms of de-regulation and delicensing, with an aim to improve ease of doing business. More than 90% FDI approvals are now through the automatic route. FDI has grown by almost 50% in the last ve years. Similarly, implementation of One Nation, One Tax through GST has brought all businesses under single tax net. Making India a global manufacturing hub - as we position India as a global manufacturing hub over the next ve years, we will take the following steps: Make In India 07 Ÿ Strengthening Companies Act - In order to incentivize compliance of law and ease of doing business, we will amend the Companies Act to impose civil liability for technical and procedural defaults of a minor nature thus unclogging the majority of the cases from the cous. Ÿ New Industrial Policy - We will announce a new industrial policy to improve competitiveness of manufacturing and services with an eye on Industry 4.0 in order to gear up for technologies like aicial intelligence and electric mobility. Special eo will be made for MSMEs. Ÿ Network Approach for Growth - We understand that clustering and network eects are impoant in order to build competitiveness in cuing edge industries. Therefore, we will invest in creating clusters/networks that can take on the world’s best. Public procurement and government incentives will be used actively to build up these clusters and encourage job creation. Ÿ Top 50 Ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index- In the last four years, India has climbed 65 places in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. We will fuher work in this direction to take the country’s ranking into the top 50. A special package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee Scheme of the Government of India is an impoant component wherein loans to MSME are guaranteed. Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18. We would aim to take this gure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024. Technology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector. Our government has taken a major step in expanding of ‘Technology Centres’ and we would achieve more than 150 such centres all over the country by 2024. These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and prototyping of MSMEs. They will expose MSMEs to Aicial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Viual Reality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero Eect. The Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would provide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year. Welfare of Small Traders - Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 09 10 11 12 Ÿ To protect the interests of small traders, we will provide an accident insurance of 10 lakh rupees to all the traders registered under GST. Ÿ On the lines of Kisan credit card, we will also create a scheme to give merchant credit card to registered merchants. Ÿ We will establish National Traders’ Welfare Board and create a National Policy for Retail Trade for the growth of retail businesses Entrepreneurship & StaUps 13 Ÿ Creating 100 Innovation Zones in Urban Local Bodies Ÿ Initiating ranking of Central Ministries, depaments, State Governments and CPSUs for their increased engagement with sta-ups and in bringing in innovation and newer technologies and global practices and skills. Ÿ Easing regulatory requirement for sta-ups Ÿ Targeting time spent for tax compliance at 1 hour per month Ÿ Facilitating establishment of 50,000 new Staups in the nation by 2024 Ÿ Seing up 500 new incubators and accelerators by 2024 We will continue to promote and encourage Staups through creation of a ‘Seed Staup Fund’ of ₹20,000 crore. We will suppo entrepreneurial ventures staed by individuals from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Communities, or Economically Weaker Sections and take forward the ‘Standup India’ initiative. We will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial Noheast' scheme to provide nancial suppo to the micro, small and medium industries and for employment generation in the Noheastern state. 14 15 16 17 Within the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many dierent service segments. In paicular, we will identify specic places of cultural or natural impoance in order to develop them as comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at transpo connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, enteainment and other services in an integrated way. We will make an eo to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the government will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest depament and local government work together with the travel and hospitality industry. All UNESCO heritage sites in India will be upgraded to international level facilities. The Noh eastern states and our Island/coastal areas will be developed while being sensitive to conserving their ecological uniqueness. Similarly, places of cultural impoance will be developed while maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an eo will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage. Using Tourism to Cluster Services 18 19 20 We will continue our crackdown on Benami propeies and illegal foreign bank accounts to benet honest taxpayers and the poor of the country. We will also expedite our actions to bring fugitive economic oenders back to India and prosecute them for their crimes. Transparent economy 21 We will ensure faster customs clearance of international cargo by relaxing clearance procedures, introducing self-declaration etc and adopting new scanning technology. We will also provide adequate nancial and institutional suppo for expoers and expo organizations to build capacity and equip them with adequate information to ensure unhindered expos. International Trade 22 19 Infrastructure Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy. In the 10 years of UPA rule, policy paralysis and corruption had derailed infrastructural development. The last ve years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, infrastructural roll out has been put back on track. For the rst time, India has staed marching and is being seen on the path of global standards in infrastructure and civic amenities. The speed of constructing rural roads has doubled and 90% of rural road connectivity has been achieved. Fuhermore, India has become a net expoer of electricity and has achieved maximum production of coal and maximum distribution of LED bulbs. There has been an unprecedented rise in the po capacity and the speed of seing up new rail lines, gauge conversion, and electrication of railway tracks has doubled. We have invested at an unprecedented level in building infrastructure in the last ve years. This includes massive budgetary allocation for railways, highways, village roads and other health as well as educational infrastructure. We have also staed and matured into a new technology driven plaorm called PRAGATI (Pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation). Through this, mechanism, we are de-bolenecking major projects on a regular basis through video conference with ocials across the country. Going forward, We will aim at next generation infrastructure which will include gas grids and water grids, i-ways, regional airpos and way side amenities along National highways. In addition to ensuring eciency in the economy this will also lead to creation of a large number of jobs and livelihood oppounities. We will continue the fast pace with more and more public and private investment and ecient ground level management on building of infrastructure fuher and to improve the quality of life and enhance the ease of living. Foundation for New India 01 02 03 Urban Mobility -We will launch a National Urban Mobility Mission to provide technology based urban mobility solutions to all urban local bodies and increase the use of public transpo, enhance walkability and cycle use. Under this mission, we will incentivize cities to integrate the public transpo systems such as metro, local trains and local buses with the private service providers in the sector such as, private bus operator, private taxi operator, the auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaw services, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure for a seamless and smooth last mile connectivity. We will also promote a common mobility card/ ticketing across dierent modes of transpo. We will set up ve regional centres of excellence on urban issues. These centres will provide suppo to states and local bodies on issues of urban governance and growth. Through the development of infrastructure and connectivity, we will ensure the fuher development of suburban townships and new urban centres. In the next ve years, we will ensure that 50 cities are covered with a strong metro network. Ensuring Urban Development 04 05 06 07 We have constructed over 9 crore toilets under our agship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission. We will take the Mission to a new level through sustainable Solid Waste Management in every village. Through the mission, we will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste through emphasis on faecal sludge management and reuse of waste water in rural, peri urban and unsewered areas. We will ensure that all habitations aain open defecation free status and those that have aained the status sustain the behavioural change. Swachh Bharat Mission 08 09 20 We will ensure sustainability of water supply through special focus on conservation of rural water bodies and ground water recharge. We will launch ‘Jal Jivan Mission’ under which we will introduce a special programme, ‘Nal se Jal’ to ensure piped water for every household by 2024. Water is a critical resource but its management is spread across various depaments, even at the Central level. We will form a new Ministry of Water unifying the water management functions to approach the issue of water management holistically and ensure beer coordination of eos. The Ministry will expeditedly take forward the ambitious programme, conceptualized by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for linking rivers from dierent pas of the country and ensure a solution to the problems of drinking water and irrigation. We will initiate work on this programme by constituting an authority. Jal Shakti 10 11 12 We want to become a world leader in e-mobility. 10,000 crores have already been allocated to launch a programme for promoting clean energy and baery operated vehicles. We will fuher work on this front to ensure expansion of this new mobility experience. In continuation to our existing milestone of constructing roads at an unprecedented pace, we will construct 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next ve years. We will double the length of National Highways by 2022. We will bring in new technologies and designs in road construction, operation and maintenance. We will complete the Phase-1 of Bharatmala Project expeditiously. We will also launch Bharatmala 2.0 project especially with a view to suppo the states to develop state road networks connecting the interior regions to the main roads and to eectively leverage the economic potential and market oppounities of the concerned regions. Road Connectivity 13 14 15 16 We will make all eos to ensure electrication of all railway tracks by 2022. We will expand connectivity and experience of high speed trains and new version trains such as Vande Bharat Express across the length and breadth of the country in the next ve years. We have made all eos to make the experience of rail journey safe, smooth, clean and satisfying and have achieved great results. We will continue the pace of work in this regard and encourage private paicipation in the development of railway amenities and infrastructure and provision of services. We will ensure conversion of all viable rail tracks to broad gauge by 2022. We will complete the dedicated freight corridor project by 2022. We will equip all main railway stations with Wi-Fi facility by 2022. We will launch a massive programme for modernization of railway stations in the country. Railways 18 19 17 20 21 22 23 24 2 In 2014 there were 65 functional airpos and there are a total of 101 functional airpos today. In the next ve years, we will double the number of functional airpos. Establishment of New Airpos 25 We will undeake the upgradation of infrastructure for connecting the coast and hinterland to ensure smooth transpoation. Potential of coastal development for transpoation, tourism and for economic upliment of coastal communities has remained unexploited in the country. To exploit this potential fully, we have launched the Sagarmala programme and will ensure speedy completion of the projects under this programme. We will double our po capacity in the next ve years. We will fuher encourage integrated development of coastal areas including coastal cities, coastal transpo and coastal industrialization. We will continue to focus on development of inland waterways for shiing inland cargo movement from road and rail to water transpo. Coastal Development 26 27 28 29 Exceptional work has been done in adding to the electricity generated and in laying down of transmission lines and in puing up the nationwide transmission grid. With these milestone achievements, India can now claim that quantum of or access to electricity is no longer an issue. In fact, India has also become a net expoer of electricity. Now, we will work towards: We had made a commitment to provide 24x7 electricity to all and the country has substantially aained the goal. All remaining villages have been electried. Similarly, almost all remaining households have been provided with an electricity connection. Thus, we are near completion of our promise in a record time. We will fuher work towards completing any unnished task in this regard. Energy 31 32 Ÿ Ensuring a right mix of energy which leads towards a cleaner environment Ÿ Making the state electricity entities nancially sound and administratively more ecient. Ÿ Supplying quality electricity to all consumers India has become a global champion in addressing the issues of climate change through eective and feasible interventions. We have achieved cumulative installed renewable energy capacity of 76.87 GW as on February, 2019 and are on track to achieve our goal of 175 GW by 2022. We will continue our eos in this regard and make it a popular movement. We will fuher make all eos to invite other countries of the world to become members of the International Solar Alliance. 33 Every Gram Panchayat will be connected with high speed optical bre network by 2022.

Digital Connectivity 34 30 22 Health for All Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi took a historic step last year through the roll out of Ayushman Bharat the World’s largest healthcare programme. In addition, we have conceived and implemented programmes for controlling prices of medicines, and signicantly expanding Medical education. We are commied to leverage all resources to ensure that the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is reduced and all citizens can avail necessary medical services. While providing annual health cover of Rs. 5 lakh to 10.74 crore poor families under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana under Ayushman Bharat, we also initiated a programme to set up 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by 2022. Till date 17,150 HWCs have become functional. We will take up the programme of HWCs to next level. We will target provisioning of telemedicine and diagnostic laboratory facilities at these HWCs by 2022 to ensure quality primary medical care to the poor at his doorstep. We will create an essential devices list and a separate pricing policy for medical devices to ensure their accessibility and aordability to masses. Making Healthcare Accessible We will also accelerate the reforms in paramedical education sector so as to increase the availability of nurses, pharmacists and other paramedical personnel. With our initiatives, we have successfully reached the stage of ensuring one Medical College for every three Parliamentary Constituencies. We will take it forward and set up one Medical College or Post Graduate Medical College in every district, through public or private paicipation, by 2024. To sta with 75 such Medical Institutes will be set up by 2022. This would ensure availability and accessibility of quality secondary and teiary medical care to the citizens across the diverse landscape of our country. In a mere span of 5 years, we have increased the number of MBBS seats by 18,000 and that of Postgraduate Medical seats by 12,000. We would fuher accelerate the pace of reforms in medical education sector so as to ensure transparency on one hand and improved doctor: population ratio on the other hand. With our eos we will double the number of MBBS and Specialist doctors in the country by 2024 as compared to the work done from 1947 till 2014. Fuher, we will also accelerate the reforms in para-medical education sector so as to increase the availability of nurses, pharmacists and other paramedical personnel. Strengthening Health Infrastructure We will endeavour to make the National Nutrition Mission a mass movement and strengthen infrastructure and capacity in all Anganwadis. The Mission Indradhanush programme has ensured full immunization of 3.39 crore children and 87.18 lakh pregnant mothers. Fuher, the annual increase in the rate of immunization has jumped from 1% per year to 6% per year. Continuing this pace, we will ensure full immunization coverage for all the children and pregnant women by 2022. Immunization and Nutrition Tuberculosis claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease. As on today, more than 25 lakh citizens are suering from TB while over 3 lakh persons die due to TB every year. The disease mainly aects the poor and malnourished. We have rolled out a Special Mission to eliminate TB from India by 2025. We will ensure this becomes a success much ahead of the target given in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Eliminating Tuberculosis 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 23 Good Governance We are commied to the idea of simultaneous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure ecient utilisation of government resources and security forces and for eective policy planning. We will try to build consensus on this issue with all paies. Single Voter List - In order to ensure that every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all public bodies and to avoid confusion created by multiple voter lists, we will strive to ensure a common voter list for all elections. Simultaneous Elections 01 02 Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always maintained that Good Governance is the cornerstone of good politics. In the last ve years, we have put in place a framework of governance which will yield rich dividends over the next generation. In order to curb corruption, the Modi government has taken many eective steps such as enacting the Fugitive Economic Oenders Act,2018, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act,2018, and the Benami Transaction Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2016. We have eliminated ineia in the government by ensuring decisive actions under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and will continue to make eos to ensure more eective governance and transparent decision making. Corruption-free Bharat 03 To transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of “Minimum Government and Maximum Governance” and we will bring reform in the Civil Services and implement it in a manner to achieve the same. In order to ensure beer implementation of policies and coordination, we will merge similar and complementary depaments into sectoral ministries. This will allow policymakers to frame holistic and comprehensive policies on the one hand and ensure smooth implementation on the other.

We will sta the 'National Program for Rapid Research in Socially Contextual Technologies' to create research paths in desirable technologies and to manage nancing of such projects in coordination with the private sector. 19 We have ensured speed and eectiveness in issuing forest and environmental clearances for eligible projects due to which we have added around 9000 Sq. Kms to the forest cover of the country. We are commied to maintaining this pace through adoption of cleaner practises to make our nation a greener country. We have evolved technologically beer strategies and devices to map the level of pollution in cities and rivers and have taken eective steps to reduce the level of pollution in major cities, including the national capital. We will conve the National Clean Air Plan into a Mission and we will focus on 102 most polluted cities in the country. Through conceed action, we will reduce the level of pollution in each of the mission cities by at least 35% over the next ve years. We have continuously protected and promoted the interest of forest dwellers paicularly the tribal communities. We have endeavoured to provide basic amenities, such as roads, telephone connectivity and cooking gas connection in addition to houses and toilets, at the doorstep of people living in remotest forest areas. We are commied to continuing our work in this direction. Forest and Environment 20 We will ensure the Himalayan States are provided special nancial assistance in the form of a 'Green Bonus' to facilitate the protection and promotion of forests in those states. Protecting the Himalayas 23 We have taken impoant steps such as establishing the Island Development Authority to ensure the overall development of the island regions. We will continue to focus on these areas given their economic potential and strategic impoance. We will preserve the unique identity of Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands and build a worldclass infrastructure compatible with the local ecosystem. We will focus on fully developing the potential of tourism in these islands to bring transformational improvement in the standard of living and income of the residents. Focussing on Island Territories 24 We will develop Union Territories as models of development and good governance, and ensure the highest quality of living, citizen services and infrastructure for the residents of Union Territories. Focussing on Union Territories 26 We will continue to focus on the development of infrastructure and improved connectivity in this region to ensure that the Noheastern states duly paicipate in the economic progress of the country. We will continue to take the necessary steps to leverage the tremendous potential of hydroelectric, tourism, hoiculture etc in the Noheastern states. We are commied to ensure that the unique linguistic, cultural and social identity of the Noheastern States is adequately protected and take steps to ensure the same. We have ensured that the insurgency in the Noheastern States is brought under control and the security situation in these states improved signicantly. We will leverage this situation to ensure accelerated development of the Noheastern states. Development of Noheastern States 27 21 22 25 28 29 26 Yuva Bharat - Tomorrow’s India We need to create stepping stones for the next-generation in order to ensure that they can paicipate more fully in building New India. Ÿ We will continue to promote and encourage Staups through creation of a ‘Seed Staup Fund’ of ₹20,000 crore. We will create new oppounities of employment by providing more suppo to the 22 major 'Champion Sectors' identied as the main drivers of Indian economy. We will optimally leverage the untapped employment-generation of potential of sectors such as defence and pharmaceuticals to take advantage of the oppounities available in domestic and foreign markets. Ÿ We will launch a new scheme to provide collateral-free credit up to ₹50 lakh for entrepreneurs. We will guarantee 50% of the loan amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for male entrepreneurs. Ÿ We will set-up new 'Entrepreneurial Noheast' scheme to provide nancial suppo to the micro, small and medium industries and for employment generation in the Noheastern state. Entrepreneurship & StaUps- To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we will take the following steps : Ÿ More than 17 crore entrepreneurs have availed loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. We will expand this initiative fuher to take the number of beneciaries of Mudra loans up to 30 crore. Creating Oppounities for Youth Ÿ We will launch a special awareness and treatment programme for de-addiction among youth to protect them from the harmful eects of substance abuse and addiction Ÿ We will incentivise and reward self-organized groups of youth who adopt social assets like schools, hospitals, lakes, public gardens etc. and ensure their maintenance and cleanliness to encourage greater civic engagement of the youth. Engaging Youth with Society - To ensure increased paicipation of youth in our society, we will take the following steps : Youth in Urban Governance - We will suppo a large scale internship programme for the youth in urban local bodies, matching skills needed by the local bodies and providing the young with much needed understanding of urban issues. Youth In Governance Our government has taken comprehensive steps to develop the culture of spos in the country through the 'Khelo India' scheme, and we will continue to provide adequate resources under this scheme to ensure the achievement of declared objectives. Under this scheme, special aention will be given to encourage spoing talent among women and tribals. We will map state and district-wise spo talent and strengths, recognize the traditional spoing practices and focus on the promotion of specic spos in specic regions. Spos 01 02 03 04 05 06 27 We will suppo the creation of a mini-stadium in each sub-district, with the paicipation of state governments, to encourage spos and to make spoing infrastructure available in the rural areas. We will promote the Fit India campaign as an integral pa of building a culture of spos in India and will consistently undeake necessary steps to encourage broader awareness and paicipation in the campaign. In order to fuher promote spos, we will introduce practical spos courses as pa of the educational curriculum and also establish a National Spos Education Board for the development of spospersons. We will formulate a mechanism to ensure that the capacity of existing spoing infrastructure is easily accessible for use of spospersons and new models including PPP will be explored to ensure maintenance and management of such assets. 07 08 09 India is a youthful country Education for All Having achieved access and equity in school education, our emphasis will now be on quality of learning. We have already identied learning outcomes for various classes and our priority in the next ve years will be to ensure that children achieve these learning outcomes. We will focus on teachers training and capacity building as a key factor in achieving these learning outcomes. We consider it our duty to provide a conducive environment for talented children in our country to facilitate them to unleash their talent. For this, we will initiate a ‘Prime Minister Innovative Learning Program’ to bring together such children for a ceain period in a year in one place from all over the country and provide them with facilities and resources for them to excel. This would instill a culture of lateral thinking and innovation among them. We will establish National Institutes of Teachers’ training. These institutions would provide four-year integrated courses that would set the standards for quality teachers in our schools. We will also motivate States to replicate this model as it is our rm belief that quality teachers lay the foundation of quality learning. We are commied to using technology in classrooms and in impaing education. We will move ahead to provide sma classes to our children in schools. To begin with, we will initiate this process in the secondary classrooms. Kendriya Vidayalalas and Navodaya Vidayalas have done yeoman service in the eld of school education. In order to cater to the demands of more such schools, we aim to open another 200 such schools by 2024. Primary and Secondary Education 01 02 While keeping the education system in pace with modern trends and knowledge, our eos will continue to be oriented towards ensuring a global, scientic, outcome-focused, knowledge-oriented, accessible, inclusive and student-friendly education system in order to ensure that students can optimally benet from the education system. 03 04 05 We have given due emphasis to on-line courses as a medium of delivering education in the last ve years. We will take it to the next level and make it a major resource for impaing higher education. We will take all necessary steps to increase the number of seats in Central Law, Engineering, Science and Management institutions by at least 50% in the next ve years. We will also motivate States to accordingly increase the number of seats in State institutions. While we have world-class Technology, Science and Medical institutions, the same needs to be replicated in other areas. We will set up an As, Culture and Music University with a focus on ne as such as music and dance. We will also open a state-of-the-a Hospitality and Tourism University and a Police University. States will be encouraged to establish similar institutions of excellence. We will relook the role of existing regulatory institutions’ and make necessary changes in the legislation to ensure a regulatory overhaul. We will formulate new regulatory mechanism to provide autonomy to quality institutions and focus towards seing national standards. It will work towards promoting excellence and quality learning in higher education while providing academic and functional autonomy to institutions.  Higher Education 06 07 08 09 29 In the past ve years, our emphasis has been on quality higher educational institutions and Institutions of Eminence have been a step in that direction. We will take it forward in the next ve years and create 50 such institutions by 2024. In the past 5 years, a number of our institutions have gured in the top 500 institutions of the world. We will encourage academic institutions towards excellence and motivate more such institutions to rank among the top 500 institutions of the world. To ensure innovation and quality research, we will incentivise the industry to collaborate with our scientic labs and technological institutions, to undeake research in cuing-edge technology and science. We will consciously promote a programme for ‘Study in India’, which will focus on bringing foreign students to study in higher educational institutions in our country and make India a major destination for education for foreign students. We have launched the ‘National Digital Library of India’ and provided access to e-books and many other papers to the students free-of-cost. To fuher promote a research-orientation in our higher education institutions, we will take it forward by providing access to leading journals free of cost to the students. We will formulate a ‘National Policy for Reskilling and Upskilling’ to evolve a exible and industryresponsive workforce which is capable of accessing new oppounities and to insulate it from technological shocks. Skill Development 15 11 12 13 14 10 30 Women Empowerment As, The Prime Minister has stated that ‘India needs not just women development, but women-led development that makes women the leading force of our development trajectory’, and as per this belief, we have determinedly gone beyond tokenism to take substantive measures to ensure overall development of women and achieve gender equality. Building on these positive measures we will continue to pursue the course of holistic development and increased paicipation of women in society and economy. The gains made under our pioneering ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme have been impressive. We are commied to continue to build on these gains to provide accessible and aordable quality education to all women. We will ensure that ample nancial suppo is available to girls through out their education and subsidised education loans are provided for higher education. During the last ve years, we have focussed on ensuring a safe and dignied life and access to basic resources for women through various schemes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Saubhagya. In the next 5 years, to ensure nancial empowerment among women in rural and semi-rural areas and create beer employment oppounities for them, we will make every eo to ensure access to credit and other resources, capacity building, market and distribution network for women entrepreneurs, SHGs and women farmers. To generate beer work oppounities for women, 10% material to be sourced for government procurement will be done from MSMEs having at least 50% women employees in their workforce.This will cover various impo substitution items including, but not limited to, apparel, leather, paper and wood, aicles, stone items like idols, etc, plastic and rubber items, furniture, clocks, toys etc. We are commied to make women equal paners in and equal beneciaries of the progress and prosperity of the nation and will formulate a comprehensive ‘Women in Workforce’ roadmap focussed on dramatically increasing the female workforce paicipation rate over the next ve years. We will also encourage industries and corporates to generate beer employment oppounities for women. To ensure greater paicipation of women in the workforce, it is necessary to enable them to continue in the workforce by providing suppo for child care. Our government has already made it mandatory for any establishment with 50 or more employees to have the facility of a creche. We will now strengthen the creche programme with special focus on the needs of parents employed in the unorganized sector to provide crèche and child care facilities by leveraging the existing Anganwadis, civil society organisations and the private sector. We will ensure that the number of childcare facilities is increased three fold by 2022. Women-led Development We have determinedly taken substantive measures to ensure overall development of women and promote gender equality. Continuing our work, we will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices such as Triple Talaq and Nikah Halala. Ensuring Equal Rights The government has launched a major initiative on malnutrition by launching the POSHAN Abhiyan. We will reduce the malnutrition level by at least 10% in the next ve years, doubling the rate of reduction of malnourishment. Continuing our eos to ensure safe motherhood through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan and Ayushman Bharat, we will focus on ensuring good quality, easily accessible and aordable maternal healthcare services for all women. Ensuring a Dignied Life for Women 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 31 We have very signicantly increased the honararium of ASHA and Anganwadi workers. We will increase the coverage of Ayushman Bharat to include all Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers to ensure improved health and social suppo system for these frontline workers. To create a positive atmosphere for women, promote gender justice and create awareness on issues related to women, gender sensitisation courses will be made an essential pa of all educational institution’s curriculum and training modules of public oces. We will ensure that all reproductive and menstrual health services are easily available to all women across India and with the expansion of ongoing Suvidha scheme, sanitary pads at an aordable cost of just Rs. 1 will be provided to all women and girls. Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws in order to commit crimes against women, in paicular in a time-bound investigation and trail for rape. In such cases, forensic facilities and fast track cous will be expanded to bring convicts to justice. We are commied to ensure the welfare of widows of defence personnel who were killed in action. We will formulate a dedicated programme for the creation of work oppounities, provide skill training and strengthen social security mechanism for widows of our Mayrs. Women's welfare and development will be accorded a high priority at all levels within the government, and the BJP is commied to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment. Reservation for Women 09 10 11 12 13 14 Aer all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal paners in the development of the country. - Shri Narendra Modi 32 Inclusive Development We are commied to ensure benets of constitutional provisions of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. We will ensure that proper representation and oppounities are available for these sections. We have decisively ensured that the economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society who belong to the non-reserved category are represented and have access to government jobs and higher education through the 10% EWS reservation which was long overdue. We will implement the law in the same spirit while ensuring that SCs, STs and OBCs continue to have their fair representation. Ensuring Justice for All 01 02 The creation of an open and egalitarian society is central to the philosophy of the BJP. ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ is at the hea of PM Modi’s vision of New India. To ensure that quality education is available and easily accessible, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya Schools will be at par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and besides providing state of the a training in spos and skill development, these schools will have special facilities for preserving local a and culture. We will establish 50,000 ‘Van Dhan Vikas Kendras’ in the tribal areas of the country to ensure the availability of primary processing and value addition for forest produce and to provide employment for tribals and increase tribal income. We will make adequate provisions for personal safety equipment and accelerate the adoption of mechanized cleaning to ensure occupational health and safety for Safai Karamcharis. Continuing our eos to promote social and political empowerment, we will ensure that the rights of all forest dwellers are fully protected. Strengthening ‘Sabka Vikas’ 03 We have been successful in extending the food security cover to over 80 crore people from poor and lower-middle-income families who are receiving food grains (wheat/rice/coarse grains) at highly subsidized prices. We will fuher widen this cover to provide subsidized sugar (at Rs. 13 per kg per family per month) to these 80 crore families in line with our moo ‘Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas’. We are commied to bringing down the percentage of families living below the povey line to a single digit in the next ve years. The unprecedented success of the Jan Dhan Yojana has dramatically improved nancial inclusion in India. We will take fuher steps to ensure access to bank branches, payment banks and banking correspondents by creating a new data-sharing framework that builds on the success of Jan Dhan and Aadhaar plaorms while ensuring data privacy and security. With this scheme, we will ensure that every Indian has access to banking facilities within a radius of 5 km. We will also launch a technologyenabled programme for broader nancial literacy by complementing nancial literacy with mass media campaigns to provide information on nancial products and their use to enable eective paicipation of every Indian in the nancial system. We will ensure pucca houses for families either living in kuchha houses or without access to housing by 2022. Ensuring welfare of Poor 07 04 05 06 08 09 10 33 Aer providing major tax relief in the recent budget, we are commied to fuher revise the tax slabs and the tax benets to ensure more cash and greater purchasing power in the hands of our middleincome families. We will make all eos to ensure that our aspirational middle class has access to education, employment oppounities and suitable urban infrastructure for a beer quality life. Responsive to the Needs of Aspirational Middle Class 11 12 Inclusive development also means inclusion by geography. To this end, our Government has identied 115 aspirational districts that are being given special aention. We intend to continue with this eo to ensure that these districts catch up with the rest of the country. Similarly, we have already laid the foundation for economic and social progress of Eastern India through improved connectivity, construction of high impact infrastructure projects and provision of adequate nancial resources. We intend to continue our eos to resolve the geographical imbalance of the said region and ensure that Eastern India is an equal paicipant in the progress and growth of the nation. In PM Modi’s words, this is ‘Purvoday’ (Rise of the East). Commitment to Geographical Equity 13 We are commied to the empowerment and ‘development with dignity’ of all minorities (Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis etc ). Development with Dignity for the Minorities 14 We will strengthen the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana to ensure that poor senior citizens in need of aids and assistive devices receive them in a timely manner. Caring for the Elderly 15 We will oer higher interest rates on xed deposits by divyangs. To take forward the gains achieved under Sugamya Bharat, we will put in place a system of continuous accessibility audits and ratings for cities, public infrastructure including airpos, railway stations and public transpo systems, to ensure that they are fully accessible, with collaboration with industry and civil society organisations. Anganwadi and pre-school system will be strengthened to ensure that cases of disabilities are detected at an early stage. We will prioritize Divyang beneciaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and mandate accessibility benchmarks to be met in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Enabling Divyangs 16 We will recognise the 11 le out Indian Gorkha sub-tribes as Schedule Tribes.

This was the sixth consecutive quarter where the sequential growth rate was lower than the preceding one. The trend highlights the extent and duration of the loss in economic momentum. A sharp recovery from the current level is unlikely. Another data set, which captures the performance of eight core infrastructure industries, contracted by 5.8% in October. To underline, data suggests that the economic slowdown is broad and deep.Growth rate for the July-September quarter did not come as a shock. Multiple indicators pointed to a continuation of the slowdown. Of particular concern is the pattern of growth. Manufacturing contracted by 1%. To an extent, it has been adversely affected by lacklustre global trade. But there are many constraints which are entirely domestic in nature. Performance of manufacturing is worrisome from another standpoint: options for youth to transition out of low productive farm activities are being squeezed. The economy has been propped by a surge in government spending, the only segment which witnessed double digit growth. However, a surge in government spending will not provide a durable solution.The slowdown in aggregate demand appears to be of a structural nature. Pickup in demand through government spending will not be as durable as an increase powered by rising incomes. The government also is facing constraints. Nominal GDP growth, which is not adjusted for inflation, was 6.1% in the July-September quarter. This growth rate is significantly lower than what the government has based its budget arithmetic on. Consequently, tax revenue collection will be under pressure. In addition, companies have been offered the option of shifting to a lower corporate tax regime. Therefore, there are limits to the push which can come from government spending.The road ahead requires structural reform of markets of factors of production such as land and labour. Increasingly, there are signs that another factor market, that for capital, needs serious reform too. The mess in the financial sector has contributed quite a bit to the slowdown. Unless there are changes here it will be difficult to harness adequate domestic saving for investments. While reforms need to be carried out simultaneously in all markets, it’s the financial market which requires prioritisation. Unless issues which have jammed the flow of credit are not addressed, recovery elsewhere will be slow.'}]\n",

Activists say that the Gachibowli-Shamshabad stretch where the heinous crime took place, has even been declared a safe corridor by government and police. This is why citizens of Telangana’s capital city are shocked and seething, emotions mirrored in many other parts of India.As women go about getting an education, doing work, simply doing daily chores, the inability of state and society to provide them either safe passage or safe public spaces, effectively reduces theirs to a second-class citizenship. Fundamental rights like the right to equality and the right to freedom are severely compromised. Also last week a Ranchi law student was standing at a bus stop 8 km from the chief minister’s official residence, when she was abducted and gang-raped. The dark fact of the matter is that such incidents are not rare, although some cases set new benchmarks of horror.Some of the protesters in Hyderabad are demanding ‘instant justice’. But vigilantism is obviously no solution. The sanest method out of this madness is to seriously improve policing. For example even as four men have been arrested for the veterinarian’s gang rape and murder, three policemen have been suspended on her family’s accusation that they delayed acting on the complaint citing jurisdictional reasons. This kind of apathy is all too common. Or consider how the Nirbhaya fund, earmarked after the gang rape and murder case of December 2012, is lying largely unused. Whether it is conviction rates or patrolling, it needs upgrading of police resources. Fill the vacancies and skill them better, if you really care for women’s safety.'}]\n",

If the CMP really reflects the coalition’s priorities, it signals that the government’s agenda will be dominated by a potpourri of populist ideas. Notable among them are two indefensible ones, a farm loan waiver and reservation of jobs for locals. Both measures have been tried elsewhere and led to collateral damage. Even the limited benefits fizzle out soon.Two challenges facing the Uddhav Thackeray government are common to all chief ministers: low farm prices and inadequate job creation. Despite the experience all its partners have in governance, the coalition has come up with solutions well past their sell-by dates. The crop price support programme is not a solution for contemporary challenges. It is state governments which pioneered direct income support for farmers. This is a better idea than a loan waiver in terms of execution, fairness and flexibility available to farmers to react to price signals. On a positive note, the CMP’s intent to work on sustainable water solutions is sensible.The lion’s share of job creation will have to come from the private sector. The best thing a state government can do is to create conditions which result in a rapid multiplication of private sector jobs. Reservation for locals, which other states have also embarked on, weakens the bonds of national unity. And it will likely hurt availability of jobs as the private sector will be deterred from investing in the state. Unfortunately, bad ideas in India seem contagious. The eventual outcome of the paradoxical trend, where fiscal barriers between states are dismantled even as barriers to labour movement go up, will be jobs shifting to other emerging markets.

      "[{'score': 0.89067656, 'doc': 'The government opened up a controversial route for political funding in 2017, with the introduction of electoral bonds. Their genesis is back in the news, following a two-year effort of an RTI activist to ferret out documents relating to these instruments. Electoral bonds allow a potential donor to fund a chosen political party under the cloak of anonymity, to facilitate which changes were made to relevant sections of the Companies Act. The bonds are to be issued only through State Bank of India, which is aware of the identity of the donor. Given the weak institutional checks and balances in India, this does decidedly tilt the field in favour of the ruling party of the day.Note that anonymity of the donor applies only from the perspective of the voter, not necessarily from that of the government. This renders the government’s justification of electoral bonds – that the secrecy is necessary to encourage companies to donate without the fear of political retribution – suspect. An analysis of 2017-18 data by the Association of Democratic Reforms has shown that 95% of all the funding through these bonds went to BJP. Another defence is that electoral bonds come through the banking system. Although other parties, especially the regional ones, have also benefited from bonds, the government’s defence is not fully convincing.The documents obtained through RTI reveal that electoral bonds met with the disapproval of both Reserve Bank of India and Election Commission. They were worried about the implications of the inherent secrecy. There is another insidious danger in the electoral bonds system. Around the time it was introduced the government also amended provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, creating a pathway for foreign funding of political parties. When juxtaposed with electoral bonds, there is a danger to sovereignty in decision-making.With significant policy decisions in areas such as telecom ahead, the existing legislative framework raises fears of public policy being captured by anonymous private interests. In this environment, crony capitalism can flourish and even foreign interests anonymously hold sway over policy making. Hopefully, the ongoing Supreme Court hearing on bonds will remedy matters. Better still NDA government should do it on its own, in the larger national interest.'}]\n",

Now an Indian diplomat – New York consul general Sandeep Chakravarty – has gone and drawn a similar parallel. Speaking at a private event, Chakravarty was filmed saying that Kashmiri Pandits should look no further than the Israeli Jews who kept their culture alive outside their homeland for 2,000 years before they went back. He added that Kashmiri culture is Hindu culture and that he didn’t know why India doesn’t follow the Israeli example. This is absurd on multiple levels, besides comprehensively undermining the Indian position on Kashmir.For one, the well-documented expulsion of Kashmiri Pandits took place as recently as 1990, and cannot be compared to an exodus that is lost in the mists of time and could well be mythical. For another, India’s case has always been that Kashmir has a syncretic culture, which has been severely undermined by the incursion of Pakistan-supported Islamist militants in the Valley – while India is fighting to uphold Kashmir’s syncretic character which fits better with secular India than with Islamist Pakistan. By bringing in exclusivist notions instead, Chakravarty subverts the Indian narrative and gives Islamabad a handle. Ironically, India recently voted at the UN for a resolution that recognises the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.Following on the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, New Delhi has experienced considerable difficulty in making its case on Kashmir internationally. Now Chakravarty’s loose talk will add to its woes. The foreign ministry must put out an official clarification urgently that Chakravarty’s remarks do not reflect government policy, and transfer him forthwith from the New York consulate to some insignificant post.

The standard criticism of such coalitions, which had become the norm after the decline of Congress hegemony and before the current era of BJP domination, is that they form “khichdi” governments that are unable to rule due to frequent dissensions among themselves, and ultimately fall apart from their internal contradictions. In an alternative view, however, the heavily centralised model favoured by BJP imposes certain limitations on governance too.A “strong” government, for example, could build in a certain inflexibility as there is limited scope for consultation, contest of ideas, talent or initiative at grassroots and intermediate levels. This in turn can affect the quality of governance. India is a vast and diverse nation where an individual state can have the size and complexity of a normal country. This requires delegation of leadership and initiative rather than a top-down command structure. In such a context, it could be argued that a coalition government suits the genius of the country better. Indeed, the era of BJP dominance has also led to an economic slowdown of a nature the country hasn’t seen for a long time.BJP’s centralised command structure and unrelenting mode of functioning may also not be unrelated to its ally troubles, as potential allies fear getting steamrollered by it. Shiv Sena feels, for example, that its sensitivities may be respected more by NCP or Congress than by BJP, despite its overall ideological affinity with BJP. Whether the “maha vikas aghadi” survives and succeeds in Maharashtra will, indeed, be an interesting political experiment to see what style of governance can serve the country better.What may augur well for the sustainability of the aghadi is that Uddhav Thackeray will himself assume the chief minister’s post, instead of opting to operate the government through “remote control” as has been the erstwhile Sena style. Likewise Congress too plans to fully participate in the government, rather than support it from outside which too has been one of its favoured stratagems before. These moves ensure that both parties have skin in the game, instead of merely being the tail that wags the dog.'}]\n"

The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha earlier in August, and its passage into law is certainly a big step forward. The legislation is ambiguous in that it ostensibly gives every transgender person the right to self-perceived identity, yet it also stipulates that a transgender individual must apply to the district magistrate for a certificate of identity indicating transgender status. In case the person undergoes surgery to change gender to male or female, then a revised certificate will have to be obtained later.There are things to be said for and against the latter. It could be argued that it opens up transgender persons to intrusive scrutiny and robs them of agency. On the other hand, allowing transgender people to simply self-identify, as many on the left argue, can open up a can of worms too. In that case if those who are biologically male were to enter women’s sport events – or even women’s loos – simply through a self-declaration, there would be nothing in law to prevent them.There is a genuine problem, however, with the bill prescribing mild fines and punishment such as imprisonment ranging from six months to two years for offences such as physical and sexual abuse. This is out of sync with existing penal provisions for rape and sexual violence. That said, it’s also true that not all problems can just be legislated away.

The pre-dawn paperwork that facilitated the secretive swearing in ceremony for Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar had dragged three important public offices into an unnecessary controversy: that of Maharashtra governor BS Koshyari and with him the Prime Minister’s Office and Rashtrapati Bhavan. BJP will want to reassess the utility of such myopic power grab exercises when numbers clearly are not in its favour.BJP may have succeeded in Goa and Manipur but the opposition has also upped its game since then. This was evident in the manner in which Congress geared up to meet the BJP’s escalation of stakes during Ahmed Patel’s Rajya Sabha election and the 2018 invitation by Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala to BS Yediyurappa to form government. The urgency behind the Fadnavis-Pawar installation was the first indication that the newly minted combine did not have the numbers.

Moreover the floor test is to be captured in a video recording.The detailed order is necessary because events in Maharashtra have been characterised by opaqueness and underhand machinations. The role of the governor and the extent of discretionary power endowed in the office are matters which have long term consequences.

Given the current murky situation where rumours are constantly swirling about the fluctuating loyalties of opposition MLAs, only a floor test in the legislative assembly can certify the numbers on the side of BJP and Ajit Pawar’s NCP faction. However, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has shown no urgency to face the house.This is where Supreme Court needs to step in and quickly order a floor test, to be held within a day or so. Further delay only opens avenues for horse trading. Hung assemblies by their very nature are an invitation for unorthodox political arrangements but a red line is crossed when money power and intimidatory tactics are used. Unfortunately, constitutional authorities like the Governor and Speaker have disappointed in upholding conventions that have evolved since the 1990s, when India moved into the coalition era, thereby landing every dispute at the Supreme Court’s door.For instance, in the present case governor Koshyari could have taken more time to ascertain Ajit’s claim of NCP support for BJP given how the party was involved at that time in highly publicised negotiations with Shiv Sena and Congress for alliance formation. The best course now is for Supreme Court to adhere to its earlier judgments in similar cases, consistently upholding the sanctity of the floor test. In the last such instance, on May 18 last year SC ordered the Karnataka assembly confidence vote to be conducted the very next day at 4pm, with the proceedings telecast live. That’s an excellent precedent to follow.A month after electing a new assembly, governance has become the casualty in Maharashtra with political parties obsessing over maximising their gains in Cabinet formation. With opposition MLAs being herded into plush hotels and allegations of crores being offered to them to cross over, Maharashtra politics presents a distressing contrast to the grim economic prospects of ordinary people.

The branding of the match was excellent as Kolkata was bathed in a pink hue to mark the occasion. Add to this the presence of several high-ranking dignitaries, including Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, that gave the event a special touch. The novelty of having a Test match under lights with a pink ball certainly made people curious, imparting a festive spirit to the occasion.This is indeed welcome as Test cricket certainly needed a boost. There’s no denying that with the mega success of T20 leagues like IPL in recent years, the shortest format of the game has made the longest format look dull. In fact, cricketing culture as a whole has been moving towards fast, pithy matches marked by high scores. This in turn has seen budding cricketers tailor their game to meet T20 standards. All of this has seen revenue streams move in the direction of the shortest format. But Test cricket still remains the hallmark of technique and skills. This is why starting a World Test Championship was crucial to add weightage to the longest format. Day-night pink ball Tests can elevate this further.It is just as well that Indian Test cricket is experiencing a dominant phase at the moment. Skipper Virat Kohli and his boys have now won seven Test matches on the trot, taking Team India to the top of the World Test Championship table. As was evident in this series with Bangladesh, Indian fast bowlers comprising the likes of Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami have really raised their game, providing a lethal edge to the Test unit.

The Saturday morning hush-hush swearing-in ceremony for Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar does raise questions about whether the new alignment has the numbers to form a government. But BJP can claim to have drawn first blood while the Sena-NCP-Congress talks dragged on. If the government falls because Ajit’s incipient NCP faction loses steam, it would equally be a loss of face for BJP.Justifying Ajit’s crossover, Fadnavis promised a stable government instead of a “khichdi” coalition. Just before the elections, the uncle and nephew were named in an Enforcement Directorate money laundering probe. Even as he converted it into an election issue, Sharad Pawar didn’t show the same enthusiasm to defend Pawar Jr. Ajit enacted a resignation drama only to reverse the decision in no time. During the Lok Sabha polls too, rumours of tensions had swirled around the Pawar family.Ever since NCP surrendered the Maharashtra CM’s post to Congress in 2004 despite winning more seats, Sharad Pawar has kept the ambitions of his nephew and other NCP leaders under check while grooming daughter Supriya Sule. Whether it was this fault line or some other that BJP exploited remains unclear yet. Shiv Sena, preparing to assume the CM’s post after 20 years, has been left in the lurch.The voter’s mandate was for a BJP-Shiv Sena government but the realignments have paved the way for unwieldy coalitions and political instability. After Goa, Manipur and Karnataka where BJP emerged on top without the numbers the party has gone again, in its usual style, for the jugular. Only a floor test can reveal whether Fadnavis has the majority and governor BS Koshyari’s November 30 deadline has created avenues for horse trading.

As carbon generating activities multiply, carbon sinks disappear, global average temperature increases alarmingly, melting glaciers raise sea levels, the livelihood and habitat of millions are becoming bleak.Yet, in spite of depleting forests, poisonous air and shrinking fresh water resources, international climate action is stuck in politics and blame games. While developing nations hold developed nations historically accountable for the problem and rightly ask for technological and financial aid to combat climate change, some rich countries insist on equal responsibility across the board. This is why the Paris Climate Accord is unravelling right in front of our eyes. It is as if there is a suicide pact among the seven billion people on Earth to push the planet towards catastrophe.Perhaps another factor contributing to climate inaction is the feeling that not all of humanity will perish in the oncoming disaster. Maybe those living in richer countries will have the technical resources to shield themselves from climate calamities. But even if half of humanity survives the mass extinction, what kind of human civilisation will be left behind? A world full of selfish survivors lacking empathy?

A year back, he received an offer from a company to supply two cranes, both 250 metric tons in strength. He needed Rs 5 crore to commence production. Without any assets to pledge, he took a Rs 5 crore unsecured loan from a consortium of lenders at the interest rate of 15%. Since its birth in 2005, his company has spent over Rs 10 crore on interest.Another first-generation Dalit entrepreneur from Delhi, NK Chandan makes smart electric meter covers, junction boxes and bus bars for power companies. Since 2013, he has spent over Rs 5 crore paying interest. He once took a large sum from a private lender at an interest rate of 36%.The list of Dalit businessmen spending mind-boggling sums of money paying interest to usurious private lenders is long. Ahmedabad based Ratibhai Makwana trades in plastics. The Makwana group spends over Rs 7 crore annually on paying interest. A leader in making fishing nets, Bhavnagar based Devji Bhai Makwana spends about Rs 5 crore on interest annually. New Bombay based first-generation Dalit entrepreneur Ashok Khade has spent about Rs 10 crore on interest in the past decade. The list goes on.In collaboration with scholar D Shyam Babu, senior fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, Delhi, we have studied about 1,000 such Dalit businesses nationwide. This study was commissioned by the Centre for the Advanced Study of India, University of Pennsylvania. Led by then CASI director Devesh Kapur, who is now with John Hopkins University, the study concluded in 2015.The consistent point that emerged is that most Dalit businesses find it tough to secure bank credit. Consequently, an overwhelming majority go to private lenders who charge huge interest. Some lucky ones, Makwanas for instance, get into formal banking. But it is no wonder that not a single Dalit entrepreneur is able to enter India’s billionaire club.Post-reform Dalits have been thinking of careers beyond government jobs but the society hasn’t responded encouragingly. Mainstream India still sees Dalits as job and food seekers. Financial institutions see Dalits with suspicion, undervaluing their business acumen. Dalit businesses remain friendless. True, much has changed. Dalits have earned breathing space. But the market isn’t as caste-neutral as Dalits had hoped for.For a Dalit, being in business is like fishing in Antarctica without boots and gloves. May be one in a hundred succeeds. Despite being celebrative of capitalism as a social order, Dalit capitalism is companionless. There is no financial agency that can be petitioned for interest-free credit to Dalit businesses that pass the Motordrome test. If big businesses can be awarded tax holidays for investing in backward areas, why can’t first-generation Dalit businesses earn a similar benefit? If farmers can get credit for crop loans at 4.5% interest, and possible write-offs, why charge 8% interest from Dalit business?Dalit businesses have no empathisers either, there are exceptions though. Friend of Adivasis and Dalits, Digvijay Singh had come up with the slogan of Adivasi/ Dalit crorepatis in January 2002, and had set aside 30% government procurements for Adivasi/ Dalit businesses. He is no longer in power. The moral face of India Inc JJ Irani had unleashed a process of integrating Dalit businesses with India Inc a decade back, he now leads a retired life. Mentor of Dalit capitalism Montek Singh Ahluwalia is no longer in the system. There is no fourth public figure in this sprawling country that Dalit businesses can approach for a nuanced treatise as to how Dalit capitalism adds to India’s social strength.There is hope though, not everything is lost, Dalit middle class is flush with funds. Many Dalit families now hit the Rs 10 million mark a year. According to thinktank Adi-Dalit Foundation, 257 central PSEs employ almost two lakh Dalits who make Rs 17,451 crore annually. There are 1.1 lakh Dalits college/ university teachers in the country, together they make Rs 14,600 crore a year, and 1.7 lakh non-teaching Dalit staff make another Rs 8,200 crore a year. Over 9.26 lakh Dalit primary schoolteachers across India make Rs 55,600 crore a year. Over 1.27 lakh Dalits employed in all pubic sector banks make Rs 8,016 crore a year. This alone adds up to about Rs 1,03,800 crore a year. Just 1% contribution to a Dalit bank would mean revenue worth Rs 1,038 crore a year. There are 27 states and seven Union territories that employ Dalits. Over 40 lakh Dalits in central and state governments and PSEs make many lakh crores a year.Despite making hundreds of billions of rupees annually, Dalits have no bank or financial institutions of their own. With a little financial wisdom, and a mere 1% investment of their income, Dalits in government services alone can create banks with massive liquidity every year. Most of that money, like floodwaters, goes into the seas. Dalit middle class has not been able to tame their money into their own banks. If no one else, Dalit middle class alone can fund Dalit capitalism project that can produce Dalit billionaires worth the Indian billionaire club membership. Dalit billionaires can create a bigger spark than Dalit politicians occupying top public positions.So fellow Dalits, awake, channelise your incomes into your own banks, build a Dalit economy the way American Blacks have built their own economy, turning American capitalism more respectable, vibrant.\\xa0'}]\n",

So it is the case with Bihar where 52 lakh litres of alcohol have been seized till date, showing demand and supply continue to flow unbridled. Meanwhile, it’s the judiciary which is stuck with mounting prohibition-related cases, delaying justice for the common man.As a matter of fact, government – both Centre and states – is the largest litigant involved in at least 46% of the cases with courts. This includes cases involving two government wings or PSUs. Since government in India functions in various shapes and forms, it’s imperative to have a high degree of coordination to lessen intra-governmental issues landing in court. But the least that should be done to unclog the system is not make policies that are sure to end in copious litigation – prohibition is certainly one such policy.

Its economic performance since\\xa0opening up\\xa0in 1978 highlights the importance of growth in providing a better life to people. China’s average growth rate between 1978 and 2010 was in double digits, making it history’s fastest durable expansion of an economy. An outcome was that more than 850 million Chinese were lifted out of poverty. Sixteen years ago, when China’s economy was where India is today, it was\\xa0in the midst of\\xa0its double-digit growth phase. Therefore, it is meaningless to compare our growth rate with that of China.\\xa0\\xa0Economic growth is the single most important factor in providing a better life anywhere in the world. Research shows that the inflection point in history was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution when GDP per person expanded substantially for countries undergoing it. Living standards doubled in less than 50 years after being almost static for centuries. A takeaway from this lesson is that debates on the nature of the recent economic trend, whether it is a slump or a slowdown, are of no relevance. The only thing that matters is pace of economic expansion has been decelerating for over a year and a recovery is not in sight.\\xa0\\xa0The Narendra Modi government is uniquely placed to turn this situation around on account of its political capital. This should be\\xa0utilised\\xa0to speed up growth, the only surefire way of eliminating poverty and providing India’s burgeoning young population with opportunities. Instead of using the size of economy, $5 trillion, as a benchmark, the government should focus on the pace of economic growth. That is what will make the difference in lifting people out of poverty quickly as well as lending heft to India’s geostrategic goals.\\xa0\\xa0'}]\n",

The proposed legislation creates a path for Hindus and a few other denominations who have come from\\xa0neighbouring\\xa0countries, but excluding Muslims, to obtain Indian citizenship. This militates against the basic tenets of secularism as enshrined in the Constitution, particularly Articles 14 and 15 which guarantee equality before the law and forbid discrimination on grounds of religion.

But that can be determined only on a case by case basis, not read from a person’s religion alone. For example, a Hindu from Bangladesh may well be an economic migrant, while an Ahmadiyya or Shia Muslim from Pakistan could be persecuted for his religion.\\xa0\\xa0As far as the bogey of uncontrolled illegal migration is concerned the country already has laws – Foreigners Act, 1946 and Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 – and tribunals to detect, detain and deport all illegal migrants residing in the country.

Problems initially came from the overhang of bad loans made last decade that led to a slowdown in the flow of credit from risk averse banks. Shadow banks, or NBFCs, filled the breach but threatened financial stability of the entire system through poor decisions. The positive news is that the government has initiated legislative changes to arrest the slide and enhance public confidence in the financial system.It announced, last week, that the ambit of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will extend to financial service providers, excluding banks which will be covered later by a different legislative framework. This will create a pathway for orderly resolution when a financial intermediary runs into serious problems. Another important change announced by Sitharaman is that the government is set to introduce legislation to enhance the existing limit of deposit insurance of banks. This is another important step in boosting public confidence and also a precondition for further reforms.India has both an explicit deposit insurance and an implicit one helping public sector banks in times of stress. For the vast majority of banks it is the explicit one which matters. According to Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation – the RBI owned insurer – 2,098 banks, including 1,941 cooperative banks, were insured at the end of the last financial year. The ceiling for insured deposits however has remained static at Rs 1 lakh for over 25 years. Consequently, while insured deposits covered 70.8% of the total in 2000, by the end of the last financial year it dropped to 28%.The changes initiated and proposed are important. A unique feature of the financial sector is that erosion in confidence can glue up the flow of credit or undermine even relatively prudent operations. Therefore, at a time when markets are jittery measures to impart stability are welcome. Also, these measures will be building blocks on which government can bring about more reform in the financial sector architecture. In the absence of confidence the pushback against any reform which lowers direct government involvement in the commercial side of financial sector is powerful.'}]\n"

This does cast doubt on the durability of the original verdict.The dissent in the review put key issues in perspective. The relevant Constitutional provision and Supreme Court rules lay down sharp guidelines for a review.

However, the Sabarimala judgement contended with issues which overlap with other cases such as entry of women into a mosque and also Parsi women married to a non-Parsi in a fire place of Agyari.

The doctrine of what is essential to a religion was evolved by the Supreme Court in 1954.The doctrine is controversial and the most salient argument against it is that it leads the apex court into areas beyond its expertise.

After BJP and Shiv Sena failed to deliver on a power-sharing arrangement, the latter was given a bare 24 hours to put together a viable alliance with NCP and Congress. While talks between the three parties did take place, the Sena requested more time from the governor which was denied. Next, it was NCP’s turn to request for time. But governor Koshyari appears to have convinced himself that government formation isn’t possible in the current scenario.If a stable coalition between Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress is to form, this will require some time to hammer together a power sharing formula and a common minimum programme. Koshyari’s giving minimum time to both Sena and NCP to cobble together such a coalition – before precipitately declaring President’s rule – will be seen as an attempt to preclude precisely that. Not surprisingly, Sena has approached the Supreme Court against the governor’s move.More broadly speaking, the standard criticism of such a diverse coalition as the Sena is seeking to form now is that it is a ‘khichdi’ one that is bound to be inherently unstable. However, it is by no means clear that an absolute majority for a single party – or a coalition where one party is clearly dominant – always delivers superior results. In India this often creates a top-down,\\xa0centralised\\xa0style of governance – one that BJP in its current avatar also seems to\\xa0favour.This kind of government has been touted as decisive and action-oriented, and that may indeed be true in some instances. Take, for example, the quick reactions to provocations from Pakistan at the level of the central government. In other areas, for example in complex arenas such as the economy and development, a top-down model can stall initiative or decision making at the grassroots, as well as lead to a talent deficit in administration. In a vast, complex and diverse polity such as India power sharing arrangements may work better,\\xa0as long as\\xa0they can work out a suitable coalition dharma that ensures stability. Which is why if Sena, NCP and Congress do indeed eventually form the government in Maharashtra they would do well to thrash out all important issues beforehand, including the post of chief minister.'}]\n",

The judicial resolution by the topmost court came after India’s politicians proved themselves unequal to the task and all mediation efforts failed. Let the verdict now draw a line under the dispute, so that India can heal and move on. A good start has been made with most political parties welcoming the judgment. At stake is individual progress, communal harmony, national unity and constitutional morality. India’s multicultural ethos has always prided itself for tolerance to diversity and accepting the equality of religions.In allocating the disputed land where Babri Masjid once stood for constructing a Rama temple, Supreme Court has recognised evidence of a long unbroken tradition of worship by Hindus at the site. By directing the central/ UP government to award five acres of land within Ayodhya city at a prominent location to build a mosque, SC was conscious that justice would not prevail if Muslims were not remedied for the 1949 desecration when idols were surreptitiously placed inside Babri Masjid followed by its unlawful destruction in 1992.Those resorting to triumphalism must understand the spirit behind SC accepting the maintainability of Ram Lalla’s title claim. Piety and devotion of the faithful and not political, divisive or destructive machinations carried the day in favour of a temple at the site. The Centre as well as state governments must also accept and strictly uphold this judgment’s stipulation calling on them to abide by the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991, which forbids the conversion of any other place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.SC has invoked the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993, to direct Centre to create a trust to oversee temple construction. Only those willing to uphold the Places of Worship Act must find a place on the Board of Trustees, lest this creates a precedent and incentive for fuelling other mandir-masjid disputes. Picking up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to set aside bitterness and fear and move ahead as one for the country’s development, BJP and saffron parties must avoid triumphalism and drop future mandir-masjid agitations.

Two years ago, Moody’s had upgraded India’s rating. According to Moody’s, there has been an increase in the risk that economic growth will remain materially lower than in the past. This is a dismal conclusion about India’s future trajectory. It’s also one that is in sync with the assessment that the current slowdown is structural rather than cyclical in nature.Moody’s, for all practical purposes, has questioned the efficacy of the government’s policies addressing the slowdown. Consequently, the agency expects a rise in India’s debt burden. The government has certainly taken some positive steps to mitigate the slowdown but it still hasn’t come up with a coherent vision. To illustrate, even as corporate tax rates were lowered to make India globally competitive, the labour market was made more inflexible through a code on the national minimum wage. Taking measures to improve India’s ranking in World Bank’s ease of doing business is welcome but inadequate to change the mood on investment.Not only are we forecast to record the third consecutive year of a decline in economic growth, both savings and investments as a proportion of GDP have trended downward over the last few years. Unless this trend reverses, don’t expect a durable shift upwards in the economic growth trajectory. One necessary measure to reverse this negative trend is to impart stability to policy making.

On their return home, her brothers gathered a mob to hurl stones at them, killing them. This personal feud has social roots: the refusal to accept a woman’s freedom to love who she wants.Stoning was the cruel and painful death prescribed for those who transgress social and sexual codes in the Bible, Torah, some Islamic hadiths and legal commentaries. When the idea of citizenship and its rights have not been internalised, then the family and group exert their dreadful power.

And so, a woman simply choosing her own romantic path is enough to invite grievous violence – so that the community can maintain its warped notion of order.As the Karnataka case shows, socially learnt hate can disfigure the impulses of love and care.

With Adivasis forming 26% of the population and Muslims nearly 14%, this could potentially become a solid bloc hindering Das’s reelection prospects.

Therefore, government must pursue domestic reforms simultaneously with negotiations to expand India’s basket of trade agreements.India has trade agreements of some sort with about 54 countries. This is the global norm. Of the 164 WTO members, most are members of one regional trade agreement or the other. These trade agreements cover more than half of international trade. Given this backdrop, India’s decision making should be guided by a major feature of international trade: regional trade agreements can lead to trade diversion. To illustrate, even if India is the most efficient exporter of a certain kind of apparel, a new regional trade agreement which excludes India can lead to a diversion of our exports to a less efficient producer. Consequently, sitting on the sidelines is not an option.Thus, if Indian manufacturing is weak compared to China and east Asian countries, there is greater economic complementarity with the EU, or the US, or Australia – and this deserves to be explored. Moreover there is greater strategic complementarity with the latter than with China, and better trade ties could cement this. For example, rules and decision making in China are opaque and it tends to offer market access based on strategic considerations. As long as it continues to consider India a systemic rival in Asia, it will never offer unimpeded access to Indian goods and services.However, the bottomline is that India needs to shore up its sagging competitiveness through domestic reform, which has been neglected for far too long. \\xa0Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have acted in India’s immediate interest by refraining from joining RCEP now.

The issue becomes more salient with revelations that Israeli spyware Pegasus was used to snoop on Indian politicians and activists, with no clarity on the actual number of citizens whose privacy was violated. Pegasus represents a wholesale takeover of an individual’s privacy and identity – courtesy the computer and the smartphone in the digital era – making older issues like phone tapping seem relatively quaint.It was this radical threat to privacy posed by the digital era that moved the apex court, two years back, to recognise that the constitutional rights granted to an Indian citizen also include a fundamental right to privacy. If a government uses spyware like Pegasus to spy on opposition politicians or activists it would make the equivalent of the Watergate scandal a routine event, hollowing out democratic rights entirely. The Pegasus case thus dramatically highlights the need for laws to protect privacy.Snooping and official surveillance is, of course, justified in some instances – as when tracking potential terrorists or criminals. This end can be served by requiring a judicial order for placing someone under surveillance. The company selling Pegasus says it was sold only to officially authorised government bodies for prevention of crime and terrorism. Here, it is noteworthy that the Centre has not categorically denied licensing Pegasus. But even more important than the question of whether it used Pegasus or not in this instance is that the government of the day – whether at Central or state level – can use similar ware to spy on citizens anytime it wants to, even if it flagrantly breaches their fundamental right to privacy.It is thus incumbent upon government, Parliament, judiciary and Facebook which owns WhatsApp to nail this serious breach of privacy. Those claiming to have been violated like Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and activists like Bela Bhatia must themselves approach courts for redress without leaving it to PILs, often poorly drafted, that get junked for their non-serious approach.

At least 20 policemen and eight lawyers were injured and 20 vehicles were vandalised. Plus, lawyers accused the police of firing shots and injuring their colleagues. This saw the Delhi high court order suspension and transfer of police officers. But lawyers took to protests again on Monday, with video emerging of their thrashing bystanders and policemen at various spots. Yesterday, it was police’s turn to protest as thousands of them blocked one of the busiest roads in the city.When two pillars of the law and order machinery go at each other in this fashion, that too in the heart of the national capital, it highlights fundamental infirmities in administration. Police and lawyers have an interdependent relationship, and justice can only be served when each group performs its defined function. But instead of upholding the rule of law if either tries to become a law unto itself, there is bound to be a collapse of order in society.Therefore, neither can police freely manhandle lawyers – or anyone for that matter – nor can lawyers behave like goons and go around beating policemen and bystanders. Amidst anarchic protests by either group, it is the common man who suffers. Sometimes police too are guilty of looking the other way – lawyers were treated with kid gloves when they went on a rampage at the Patiala House Court in 2016. Unfortunately, today’s populist politics has successfully propagated the idea that one’s ‘hurt sentiments’ are above law and due process. If that’s a recipe for anarchy, we see the outcome on the national capital’s streets today as two prime upholders of the law abuse the law.'}]\n",

RCEP, which was negotiated between Asean and the bloc’s six free trade agreement partners, will be dominated by China. For practical purposes, India’s membership in RCEP would have been tantamount to a trade agreement with China; something Indian industry is unprepared for now. In this context, India’s decision to withdraw from RCEP is the best possible course at this moment. However, two things need to be kept in mind. Isolationism in economic matters will only lead to stagnation. The RCEP option remains on the table as other members have made clear that India can join at a later date.

Centre has belatedly begun to coordinate the firefighting. But crisis-time public posturing will not ensure an end to this practice. North India’s air pollution woes are just one manifestation of farm/ water policies gone horribly wrong.Lurking in the core of the crisis is an outdated food security doctrine that has combined with unrestrained populism to wreak havoc. What began as a buffer stock of rice and wheat has morphed into a pan-India sprawl of a few crops supported by government procurement agencies and minimum support prices. In July, total wheat and rice stock with Centre was 74.3 million tons, a whopping 33.1 million tons in excess of relevant stocking norms. The anomaly of government heavily subsidising farmers to produce excess rice at great economic and environmental cost, which then rots in FCI godowns or gets exported, must be fixed.Free power and open-ended procurement has meant that farmers pump out groundwater endlessly to grow paddy. Producing 1 kg of rice in Punjab requires over 5,000 litres of water and with an annual paddy output of 12 million tons, this amounts to shipping out nearly 45 trillion litres of groundwater. Responding to this rapacious exploitation Punjab and Haryana enacted a Preservation of Subsoil Water Act in 2009, banning paddy transplanting until June 15 to preserve groundwater during summer.This pushed the harvest further backwards towards October-November which, accompanied by the use of combine harvesters that leave paddy stalks standing and the hurry to prepare the ground for the next rabi crop in November, prompts farmers to burn stubble. As is evident, one myopic policy after another has created an environmental and public health disaster. Turning Punjab and Haryana farmers away from paddy cultivation solves all the problems at one stroke but withdrawing subsidies on power, procurement processes and MSPs, requires immense political will. This critical moment demands bipartisanship and statesmanship. Will the political class stand up as one to be counted, or continue with policies that starve us of water and breathable air? '}]\n",

By now agencies agree that farm fires are the primary culprit of the pollution spike. What we face is a seasonal problem caused by a specific set of factors: stubble burning and festival cracker bursting aggravated by slow wind movement at the onset of winter. Actually for much of this year NCR has enjoyed better air quality which brings the current spike into sharp focus. Satellite imagery of fires and the dip in air quality measurements offer a strong correlation for corrective steps.The strategy of penalising farmers isn’t working. But Punjab’s great strides in mechanising agriculture indicate that the same farmers can indeed be persuaded to shun primitive burning for machines like super straw management systems and happy seeders. No one wants farmers to junk combine harvesters and return to manual modes. Instead governments must do a better job of subsidising these machines, offering various lease-rent-purchase options, and overhauling environmentally disastrous farm policies promoting paddy cultivation in water-stressed areas.

Is it a mere manifestation of a business cycle or is it something deeper arising from structural infirmities? Economic data increasingly points to the latter. If the data did not convince everyone, a development last week will force government to look for solutions that are structural in nature. This was a verdict by the World Trade Organisation’s dispute redressal body. It upheld a complaint by US that some of India’s critical export promotion fiscal aids are inconsistent with its WTO obligations.A consequence of the verdict is that India will have to roll back over six months some of these aids in a staggered manner. The list of affected schemes spans duty free imports for exporters and one for special economic zones. This winding down will have to be undertaken during a particularly challenging period. Two recent additions to the mass of economic data highlight an important dimension of the challenge. Business information company CMIE has estimated that from May to August, about 2.5 million jobs were added. The downside is that the additions are mainly in low skill jobs and agriculture.Separately, corporate financial results for 2018-19 analysed by CMIE showed that net fixed investments grew 5.9%, the lowest increase in 16 years. When investments are not forthcoming, we shouldn’t be surprised if future data echoes the contraction of 5.2% in September’s core sector output. The blow to India’s fiscal regime for export promotion has come in the backdrop of a domestic economy which lost considerable momentum over the last 18 months. This calls for a coherent strategy which needs to take state governments on board. Tinkering for a handful of sectors will not provide the springboard for a durable increase in economic growth rate.Instead, we need a deeper reform of the inflexible and inefficient markets for factors of production such as land, labour and capital. Unless businesses grow, opportunities for youth to transition out of the agrarian economy will be very limited. These structural changes can neither be postponed nor done in an ad hoc manner. To realise the full potential of reform in any factor market, there has to be accompanying change in other areas. Until these changes are brought about India should desist from signing a treaty like RCEP, whereby even much of its existing industry is likely to be swept away.'}]\n",

Many Kashmiri politicians and activists – including former chief ministers – remain in detention. Meanwhile, a fresh spate of terrorist attacks against non-Kashmiris and ‘outsiders’ has begun, as exemplified by the recent killing of five labourers from Bengal.The Centre should utilise the closing of Kashmir’s passes in winter, which deters infiltration from across the LoC, to normalise its security situation as soon as possible. Simultaneously, it’s best to recognise there exists a great deal of disaffection in the Valley, and many took the nullification of Article 370 and scrapping of statehood as an insult. Militancy cannot be addressed unless Kashmiris are assuaged. For this, Kashmir’s political space needs to be opened up and issues worked through – no matter how bitter and contentious – even as the government makes it clear that violence and terrorism are not acceptable. Disaffection in Kashmir and Pakistan sponsored militancy are related but independent variables. While the latter has to be neutralised, the government must also work hard to win the hearts and minds of Kashmiris.

Such visits are essential to counter the propaganda offensive unleashed by Pakistan and give the world a sense of Kashmir’s ground reality.

At the same time, there is a growing appetite for data and facts, analysis and perspective that (a) have cleared multiple filters for accuracy and quality; and (b) focus sharply on explaining the present and understanding what the future has in store.Given these broad realities of the information market, a quality newspaper must concentrate its editorial resources on bringing readers the best possible value for their time and money by staying fresh in its thinking and writing.A question we are often confronted with is: How should we as a paper approach the past, especially historical events and personalities? Anniversaries, in particular, tend to produce a flood of editorial content looking back, chock-a-block with dates and places. These exercises in looking back are often mistaken for ‘depth’ and ‘intellect’. But how unique or relevant are they really?

Anyone interested in history has a plethora of choices, including niche ones, and doesn’t need newspapers to recycle the same, at-times-factually-suspect stories.Second, the present is far more complex than it used to be and the future is therefore that much more uncertain. Technology is changing everything around us – the way we live and love, commute and communicate, work and wander, plug and play – and at a pace unmatched in human history. Above all, it is disruptive and discontinuous. Yes, we all know the old saying that history repeats itself, and hence carries lessons for the future. But for the most part, it is just that – an old saying. Endless reams of newsprint devoted to the past don’t necessarily add to the reader’s understanding.Third, a vast majority of consumers of news are mostly interested in developments that inform and entertain their present and future-geared minds, and in issues that shape their lives. It is this philosophy that will increasingly drive our editorial planning every day, even on the anniversaries of history’s great and good.

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign minister S Jaishankar had highlighted India’s contention that Article 370 was not a permanent measure and that subsequent security arrangements were necessary to prevent terrorists from unleashing violence. That’s a decent start.It’s also important that New Delhi creates enough facts on the ground to complement its story. Allowing more delegations to visit J&K will convince the international community that India’s sole interest remains in normalising the situation, even as it confronts a tough security predicament with the killing of truckers ferrying apples, grenade attacks on civilians and LoC infiltration attempts. With the Block Development Council elections concluded successfully, government mustn’t delay the release of political detainees.If New Delhi has run into tough criticism lately – notably, a recent US Congressional hearing on human rights in South Asia focussed almost exclusively on Kashmir – it could also be due to developments elsewhere in India which belie its democratic and secular image. Those developments in turn could feed into Kashmir’s unrest as well. A clear articulation of secular values which will not succumb to fundamentalism can convince all nations that India’s fight is no different from theirs, as well as win hearts and minds in Kashmir. From the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits onwards, India has taken hard knocks from Pakistan-backed terrorists with extreme Islamist ideologies. But successive governments were hesitant to call out the religious motivations internationally.The Modi government has greater clarity on India’s war on terror and strategic interest in Kashmir. But its hardline Hindutva agenda on non-issues such as NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill are squandering goodwill as well as hard-earned brownie points over Islamabad. The government must instead focus on putting Kashmir back on its feet and telling India’s story better, while reversing sectarian moves elsewhere.'}]\n",

Burdened by debt and losses, a Supreme Court verdict last week added to its woes. The apex court upheld a government claim against telecom operators which will cost the latter a whopping Rs 92,000 crore. This has to be paid in three months. Telecom sector problems are not new and they have been partially responsible for pruning the number of service providers from around ten a few years ago to four today. Even as the industry struggled financially, mobile phone connections have grown exponentially over a 15 year period, and India is today the largest data consumer per smartphone.The current situation is worrisome because even as China and the US are off the blocks in the transition to the next generation technology, 5G, Indian telecom industry’s financial health is bad. 5G will require big investments and an industry burdened by over Rs 7.5 lakh crore of debt is utterly unprepared for it. There are myriad factors for the current state of the industry. But two which have played a prominent role are the political hysteria over corruption in spectrum allocation and the attendant impact on the floor prices in spectrum auctions. This is not to say that wrongdoing should be condoned. But the cure shouldn’t prove worse than the disease.India stands out when juxtaposed with China or US in spectrum auctions. China has for all practical purposes given spectrum free to gain 5G dominance. US has begun allocating spectrum at prices described as historically low. The Centre needs to display clarity in telecom strategy. Is the aim revenue maximisation? Or, is it encouragement of a sector that critically enables infrastructure and multiple economic activities? Keep in mind that ramping up economic activity eventually translates to higher government revenue.The government should move away from short term revenue maximisation. This has resulted in some of the world’s highest spectrum prices and also weakened public sector banks which have large exposures to telecom companies. The Narendra Modi government has the political capital to break this vicious cycle. Spectrum prices should be realistic. It’s not a giveaway but an investment in India’s future. Government must provide relief to the telecom sector following the apex court’s judgment. Else, lack of competition will become as much of a problem there as unrealistic spectrum prices.'}]\n"

At the same time US policy that can swing between extremes – from radical intervention to isolationism – has a great deal to do with creating ground conditions conducive to the rise of groups like IS. The genesis of IS can be traced to the US military invasion of Iraq in 2003, which destroyed that country’s government and created a societal vacuum partly filled by IS. Simultaneously, the US took its eyes off Afghanistan, where it had gone in to hunt down al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden in the wake of 9/11.As a result Afghanistan was pretty much outsourced to Pakistan – where Osama was residing – which led to Taliban’s resurgence. But Washington still appears to continue with its erratic policy swings. It cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria at the expense of the Kurds – who were US allies and the most effective fighting force against IS. The Kurds were detaining thousands of IS fighters. There are reports that many of them have escaped during the Turkish operations.This has created conditions for a possible resurgence of IS, and the region could once again experience turmoil.

But a look at the granular data shows that some recent trends in the rural economy are clearly discernible in livestock data.

This trend has been in place for a while, catalysed by the favourable economics of mechanisation. This reduces the economic worth of male bovine population. The divergence between males and females is also noticeable in buffaloes. The population of male buffaloes declined by 42.35% from 2012 to 2019. This trend has been facilitated by the government’s encouragement of artificial insemination in cattle.One of NDA’s programmes, Rashtriya Gokul Mission, aims to develop indigenous breeds of cattle. But the Indian farmer has displayed a noticeable preference for crossbreeds on account of the higher milk yields.

By way of comparison, the indigenous breed milch cattle registered an increase of 0.81% from 2012 to 2019 to 48.51 million.

If India could, say, persuade Apple to make a significant number of its phones in this country, including for export, it is made as a manufacturing power. In this context, the Indian government needs to smartly direct its efforts to attract multinational companies as the potential benefits are huge.There are two steps which need to be carried out simultaneously. From a long term standpoint India needs to carry out reforms to improve its competitiveness. However, as the window of opportunity is limited, government needs to have a policy to offset market failures to attract companies it is targeting. Much of East Asian success is on account of smart government strategy to deal with short term problems without losing focus on the need to relentlessly enhance long term competitiveness. The blueprint which government hopes to prepare should make it attractive for companies to ignore traditional challenges in India such as relatively poor infrastructure.If India is to be marketed as preferable investment destination, there is no substitute for embarking on big reforms aimed at imparting flexibility to the factors of production. It is not easy for either Indian entrepreneurs or overseas companies to acquire land to set up large assembly lines. This needs to change. Further, Bangladesh’s success in footwear and apparel exports demonstrate the impact of labour market flexibility. Finally, India needs to lift caps on direct foreign investment limits in all sectors and also reverse the policy of tariff increases to protect domestic industry. These are strategies which have no place in the contemporary world, where the race is to capture a larger share of value addition in complex products.'}]\n"

The almost immediate escalation of cross-border firing indicates that Pakistan was just waiting for the FATF meeting to culminate before resuming overtly hostile actions targeting India. The Indian response through artillery fire directed at terror infrastructure in Pakistan is appropriate in this scenario. Pakistan isn’t going to be deterred by restraint on India’s part and the Modi government realised this quite early in its first tenure.Yet the difficulty for India is that Pakistan, despite a bloody nose on several such occasions, refuses to let go of its obsession with hurting India. Since the revocation of Article 370 in August signifying the end of the Valley’s symbolic autonomy Islamabad is itching to do something, evident in Prime Minister Imran Khan’s melodramatic invocation of doomsday scenarios before world leaders. Even while its diplomatic push floundered, on a parallel track attempts to push terrorists into Kashmir Valley and stoke violence have proceeded earnestly. And with the FATF reprieve in its bag – at least for now – Islamabad may feel this is the time to pull the trigger.With winter setting in and mountain passes going to close, the cross-border firing may be a last-ditch attempt to provide cover to would-be infiltrators. The need for paramount vigilance at this time cannot be overstated. There are no shades of grey when a country hosts and nurtures terrorists on its soil. It is unfortunate that China, Turkey and Malaysia are doggedly protecting Pakistan in forums like FATF.

Congress’s dynasties and dynasts will also come under the scanner.The dynasts who have inherited constituencies from parents include some of Congress’s most fancied leaders today, most of them coming into the limelight in the past 15 years. In Haryana, the likes of Deepender Hooda, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Kiran Choudhary and even Kumari Shelja and Randeep Surjewala can boast of parents who were noted Congress leaders. In Maharashtra, this would apply to Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat, Praniti Shinde, Amit and Dheeraj Deshmukh – virtually the entire constellation at the top rung in the state.The talk of generational change that had abated with Rahul Gandhi’s unceremonious exit may again gain currency. However, a younger set of dynasts taking over from the old guard appears to have run its course in Indian politics with the Modi-Shah duo’s searing critique of inherited privilege. Congress may want to evaluate whether such paratrooping by dynasts to state assemblies and Parliament without going through the grind has led to exodus of talent from the party. Given that a dynasty is also the high command of the party, there is little likelihood of Congress being able to dispel public perceptions about its feudal, elitist and dynastic character even when it undertakes generational change.

In that election NDA had a 51.3% vote share in Maharashtra and 58.3% in Haryana, leaving opposition parties a dispirited lot.The BJP-Shiv Sena and Congress-NCP alliances remain the major political forces in Maharashtra but with one significant difference: BJP has surged ahead of the field forcing Shiv Sena to accept a supporting role in their partnership. NCP and Congress, which drew their strength from rural cooperatives, have been hampered by the exodus of key leaders. Congress’s listlessness, with no central or state leader taking on major campaigning responsibilities, has cast the spotlight on Sharad Pawar. But the firepower that BJP has directed at the opposition has few parallels.Nationalism also becomes a perfect foil to general local perception about chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and ML Khattar as clean and shrewd leaders capable of carrying party, government and influential communities along. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have not shied away from making the two state elections about Article 370 nullification and other maximalist positions on national security like NRC. That Maharashtra and Haryana are far away from Kashmir and Bangladesh hardly matters. Moreover the eve of the election has seen major retaliation against Pakistan’s unprovoked firing on Indian civilian and military facilities on the LoC. This will recall national security concerns for voters.The state of the economy could have been a major counter by the opposition. The longstanding crisis in agriculture and the lack of jobs and quality education could have resonated disenchantment in Maharashtra and Haryana where reservation demands had peaked. But even here the big question is how sharp and relatable the opposition critique is. Once again, electoral politics has failed to properly engage with these pressing issues. The key difference is that the narrative has shifted from cobbling together winning numbers through handouts and social engineering to majoritarian and nationalist rhetoric that cuts through caste and socio-economic divides.

About 1.9 million people failed to meet NRC requirements and now are in limbo. These results attracted criticism from members of BJP which is in government in Assam. The transfer order ends Hajela’s association with NRC for all practical purposes but he had been given mission impossible in the first place. Instead of scapegoating him, it needs to be understood that NRC is fundamentally flawed.The long-standing Assam cause to sift illegal migrants from citizens is unexceptionable but in practical terms, the exercise to detect illegal immigrants proved too painful and ineffective. In essence one had to prove one’s citizenship based on documentation. Insisting on rigourous documentation in a country where records are scanty is problematic. It is precisely because of poor documentation in India that the Aadhaar application provides a pathway for people without documents. Even for people with documents, the NRC exercise was not easy. The true costs involved for the entire society may never be known.Yet, BJP is pushing for NRC in other states. Home minister Amit Shah has even brought up a nationwide NRC, an idea RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi echoed last week. But the costs of having to prove citizenship in this way categorically outweigh the purported benefits. After all, despite the long court-monitored exercise in Assam no one seems happy with its outcome. The way forward should be to curb loopholes which allow illegal immigration to take place.

However, those histories began to be rewritten from about the 1970s onwards – Percival Spear’s ‘A History of India’ is hardly considered the last word in history writing nowadays – and subsequent histories can’t all be assumed to have a leftist bias as Shah suggests (although some do).What stands out, however, are concerted attempts on the part of BJP leaders to ‘rehabilitate’ Savarkar, who was charged with murder in the plot to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi. Whether or not he was part of the plot to murder Gandhi (Sardar Patel, who BJP holds up as a counter-icon to Jawaharlal Nehru, thought he was), there can be little doubt that the outlook of Gandhi – the ‘apostle of non-violence’ – was absolutely incompatible with the radical Savarkar’s. BJP prides itself as an “ideological” party, but for it to uphold both Gandhi and Savarkar is dizzyingly dissonant (the equivalent, say, of America upholding equally Thomas Jefferson and Vladimir Lenin).While Gandhi upheld “Hindu-Muslim unity” Savarkar upbraided him for his “obsession” with it, and endorsed the two nation theory much before Jinnah did. Any ‘authentic’ history will need to record this as well. Savarkar’s most alarming idea – also a keynote of the Hindutva ideology he founded – is that the patriotism of Indian Muslims and Christians is always suspect as their “holyland” is different from their “fatherland”. To the extent that it promotes Savarkar, BJP will have to clarify where it stands on this principle – accepting which would do violence to the Indian Constitution and render India a Hindu Pakistan where, too, minorities are deemed lesser citizens.'}]\n",

Therefore, for a legendary West Indian batsman of the 1990s, Brian Lara, to compare the current Indian pace bowling attack with the 1980s West Indians will make fans sit up and take notice.Any comparison across generations must be tempered by the fact that circumstances are never the same. Proliferation of technological advances in every walk of life includes cricket. To illustrate, batsmen today use protective gear which have benefited from remarkable advances in materials technology over the last three decades. Therefore, contemporary fast bowlers can never be as intimidating as those of earlier generations. On the other hand, bowlers too benefit from advances in medical science which makes them return from injuries faster.Regardless of these factors, what can be said with a fair degree of confidence is that India today has a fast bowling attack that is the best ever in its history. It’s also good enough to merit comparison with some of the better attacks in world cricket over the last 75 years.Going back to the West Indies of the 1980s, the Indian bowling attack is probably better in one respect. It can offer a variety which the West Indies could never match. India hasn’t lost its traditional strength: spinners. The current Indian bowling attack is more balanced than that of West Indies.

An important cause of this slowdown, according to IMF, is trade friction between the world’s largest economies. Two outcomes of this friction are a reduction in the volume of merchandise and the constant threat of tariff increases as countries turn insular. Given this context, India’s lacklustre two-way global trade in September may not seem disappointing. Exports declined 6.57% to $26 billion and imports fell by 13.9% to $36.9 billion. However, this view mischaracterises India’s challenge.Prior to the current slowdown, there were a couple of years when the global economy recorded a synchronised pick-up. India missed the bus on that occasion; it coincided with demonetisation and the poorly managed transition to GST. India over the last three years has witnessed a slowdown in economic growth. For a longer period, we have seen a reduction in export intensity of growth. The signs point to an economy which has lost competitiveness in relation to its peer group over the last few years. This needs to be reversed as export-led growth is a tried and tested pathway to prosperity.IMF has forecast that India will record an improvement in its growth rate next financial year. Of course, this is contingent on reforms. NDA did well recently to lower corporate tax rates as it influences investment decisions. But this needs to be accompanied by other changes which can actualise the potential of tax rate cut. For instance, the import tariff rates should be reduced to encourage a tighter integration of Indian firms in global value chains.

A stumbling block in implementing the 2010 Allahabad high court judgment was the three-way partition of the land between three claimants and none of them willing to cede any claim to the others.

It wants the Places of Worship (Special Provision) Act, 1991, that forbade the conversion of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, upheld so that all other mandir-masjid disputes end. The board also sought permission to construct a mosque at an alternate site, repair and restoration of old Ayodhya mosques, and opening up of select ASI-managed mosques for prayers. This is an opportunity to reset Hindu-Muslim ties, heal old wounds and achieve a fresh beginning at Ayodhya.The mediation, which involved two of these parties – Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board – must cross one more hurdle. The third side with a major say – the VHP-backed Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas which advocates the cause of the deity Ram Lalla – had stayed away. Even the Sunni Waqf Board is facing pushback from the influential Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind.

Second, given this context, the leadership has to have a clear economic vision that needs to be articulated as the entire system keeps looking for signals from the PMO. According to Rajan, a coherent vision is not visible. Instead, economic policy consists of a series of programmes which can sometimes be contradictory.The critique’s relevance shows up in finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s decisions. In July, a budget was presented ignoring an 18-month long economic slowdown. As sentiments worsened, budget decisions were rolled back or nullified. Also, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate was announced after the budget. However, even as the corporate tax rate was lowered the government introduced more rigidity in the labour market by prescribing a national minimum wage. Therefore, even as corporate tax changes are ushered in to make India more competitive, labour market rules work in the opposite direction.Instead of engaging the critique, the finance minister went after the messenger with an internally inconsistent argument.

Supplementary food programmes may be failing to reach the family’s most vulnerable members. It may need focusing on anaemic mothers, to alleviate low birth weight.

The moot question still remains: the Indian Constitution was established in 1950 and is applicable only since then. How far can we go back in history to correct supposed injustices? Admitting this principle would open up a Pandora’s box. For instance, Dalits could demand reparations for three millennia or so of fierce repression by upper castes, women may go back even longer in history against patriarchy, and Odisha (Kalinga then) can harbour grievances against present day Bihar for Ashoka’s costly third century BCE war.

Of course, to put an end to the torture most suspects confess to anything the police require.

This is an aspect largely absent today, leading to a situation where even well intentioned policies lead to perverse outcomes. The economic and social costs of policies devised in a vacuum are prohibitive.Demonetisation is perhaps the best example of an ill-conceived policy whose adverse effects lingered long. The casualness with which it was imposed became apparent when government, after its implementation, informed Parliament it did not have an estimate of black money in the economy. A powerful medicine with wide ranging side effects was administered without a sense of the seriousness of the problem, or much input from professional economists. Medicine without science or evidence is often quack medicine. But even GST, an excellent idea that has worked well in other countries, has been poorly implemented in India.Evidence is intertwined with data. In this context, India needs to enhance its standard of data collection and ensure its timely dissemination. The credibility of data depends on sticking to a timetable. Instead of undermining the work of the statistical system by being dismissive of data when it is inconsistent with political rhetoric, the government should work on ways of incorporating it into decision making. In a world undergoing unprecedented quantification, undermining or ignoring it can only lead to poor policy choices.One way to make better choices is to bring in more domain experts into the executive. India does, on occasion, induct domain experts through lateral entries. The Modi government entrusted Swachh Bharat to a handpicked domain expert.

However, it is rare for work which fetches an economics Nobel to be free of criticism. RCT has its share of critics. It can be drilled down to the complaint that its efficacy is overstated and it is faddish. In contrast, significant amounts of economic theory seeks to answer big questions and work out general theories.

New Delhi, no doubt, would like to remind Beijing that Indian civilisation had been Chinese civilisation’s peer. However, Beijing would be more mindful of China’s stunning rise in the present, which has reshaped power dynamics in India’s neighbourhood at a rate faster than perhaps Indian policymakers have been able to grasp.Thus China’s current GDP is five times India’s, its military modernization ensures it has outstripped India in military strength, and it is drawing close to the US in tech prowess. The larger reality remains that the power imbalance between India and China is such that while New Delhi has to walk on eggshells when it comes to Beijing’s concerns, the latter steps on New Delhi’s toes frequently and often. Consider the manner in which China took India’s Kashmir move to the UNSC, together with Beijing’s announcement just before the summit that UNSC resolutions (from seven decades ago, which nobody at the UN remembers) were a relevant route for India and Pakistan to resolve Kashmir.While the Indian side may lay a lot of store by sentiment, sentimental evocations of a shared past are unlikely to move China.

The significance of economic growth has given rise to many studies which seek to find its underlying causes and measure them. Of the many causes, perhaps none surpasses improvements in productivity. The World Economic Forum’s latest iteration of its Global Competitiveness Report explores what matters for long term growth and measures the factors influencing productivity. The results should make India’s policy makers sit up and take notice, as India over the last year has slipped in terms of both global ranking and its score.Of the 141 countries measured India stands 68th, down 10 ranks in relation to the previous year. This is worse than any other Brics country except Brazil. But what should really worry policy makers are the areas where India fares badly. Technology adoption, health indicators and skills base greatly influence a country’s long-run economic trajectory. In all these areas, India fares poorly. Unless the quality of human capital improves, it will be difficult to sustain high rates of growth. In the absence of high growth, poverty will prove difficult to eradicate or even curb.It’s important to put the results in perspective. A single year cannot dramatically affect factors which influence long term growth. But the rankings should serve as a wake-up call and get the Centre to work to a plan. At the same time, government cannot ignore immediate challenges. The recent economic performance of Bangladesh and Vietnam, which rank 105th and 67th in the competitiveness index, has been impressive. Even if these countries are lagging in improving long term influencers, they have been quick to grab new opportunities. This has led to strong export performances and the creation of a base to improve other factors influencing productivity.India has to take a leaf out of their book. In the legitimate pursuit of long term objectives, it cannot ignore immediate challenges. In this context, India needs to free up rigidities in its factor markets such as labour and land – that will help both in the short and long term.

However, there is absolutely no case to lock up scarce resources in the airline and keep ploughing in more capital. Privatising Air India will free up public resources and also help the aviation industry.Air India’s plummeting fortunes are the outcome of government’s incompetence in running a business. Government shouldn’t be in business as when it does so, tax payers pay the price. To illustrate, Air India has recorded a net loss in the last four years which put together total Rs 23,273 crore. Even as losses increased debt grew, reaching Rs 58,352 crore at the end of 2018-19. This poor performance is underwritten by tax payers as government infused Rs 11,540 crore to support the struggling airline. In a macroeconomic context characterised by fiscal constraints, supporting Air India is indefensible.The way out is privatisation. One hurdle in finding buyers is the unattractive terms on offer. Air India’s debt acts as an obstacle. One good step taken by government after the last exercise failed was to create a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named Air India Assets Holding Limited to take some debt off the airline’s books. In July, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri informed Lok Sabha that Rs 29,464 crore of debt had been transferred from the airline to the SPV. Going forward, government is expected to consult potential bidders prior to the formal launch of the privatisation exercise. This is a sensible step as it will improve the probability of success.Air India’s sale should not be viewed as a one-off exercise. It should herald a policy approach where government’s presence in a commercial operation is eschewed.

The US has been vocal about its displeasure with the Modi government’s policy of price control on medical devices and market access for agricultural goods. A limited trade agreement therefore will at least iron out some of the new complications in a fraught trade relationship.The US-India trade negotiations have been taking place alongside talks to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This potentially includes Asean and six other countries, including India and China. RCEP has triggered a palpable sense of unease among sections of Indian industry, primarily on account of China’s inflexible positioning. Even though there is strong push by some countries to conclude a deal in November, the China factor makes it tricky. The US-India trade negotiations need to be viewed in the backdrop of current challenges confronting cross-border trade. WTO recently forecast that world trade in both 2019 and 2020 will find it tough on account of trade tensions and economic uncertainty.India needs to limit the negative fallout of this trade environment. Exports are an essential engine of an economic revival. India’s slowdown can partially be attributed to the decline in exports as a percentage of GDP over the last few years. One solution is to reverse the slide in trade ties with US, India’s most important economic partner. Given the level of differences and the beginning of a US election cycle, a limited deal may be the only possible outcome now. But it should serve as a stepping stone to a far more comprehensive trade relationship in future.'}]\n",

The draft manual has been prepared by a committee appointed by the vice-chancellor and the university has sought observations and suggestions till October 18. The manual prescribes new curfew timings for hostels — 11 PM or half an hour after the library closes — bans visitors after 10.30 PM and prohibits guests of the opposite sex in the rooms.Plus, if students are found protesting or carrying out dharnas, they would be served an eviction notice. The senior hostel warden would also have the right to impose a fine up to Rs 10,000 for violations. While it is true that the manual hasn’t been updated since 2005, the new rules do smack of an attempt to curb the freedom of JNU students.After all, it needs to be borne in mind that these are adult research scholars, not school children. Therefore, hostel rules need to be tailored accordingly. Besides, for some years now the administration has been accused of trying to change the character of JNU.

While the Supreme Court has tried to limit the meaning of sedition to a direct and immediate incitement to violence akin to a “spark in a powder keg”, in practice it has been applied to even the most commonplace raising of questions by Indian citizens.Democratic expression of views must be permitted and laws incompatible with such a basic right, such as the one on sedition, must be consigned to where they belong – the trash can of history.

The mess in Assam notwithstanding, the NRC idea is catching on elsewhere with no thought for document deficient citizens, especially the poor, among us.On Tuesday, Union home minister Amit Shah promised an NRC in Bengal. “India for Indians” is a legitimate nationalist slogan. But differing interpretations of who is local and non-local in a document-poor society make attempts to flesh out this theoretical nationalism through exercises such as NRC impractical. Moreover, BJP’s undisguised appeal to non-Muslims promising to cover them through the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) before NRC is implemented has stoked opposition in Assam and other north-east states. Too many states have witnessed regional, linguistic, religious and ethnic chauvinism in the past and all these could just flare up again.The combination of a religion based CAB and a bureaucratic, arbitrary and error-prone NRC violates basic constitutional rights like equality before law (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion (Article 15). Alongside such constitutional violations is the failure to articulate a roadmap for NRC and what becomes of those who lose out.

From September 24-26, there were 107 fires in the state compared to just 11 fires during the same period last year. If the trend continues, Delhi could again become a veritable gas chamber around Diwali on October 27.Although the Delhi government has shown it is alert to the problem a permanent solution to stubble burning remains elusive. At the root of the problem is economics. Burning is the cheapest and quickest option available to farmers to prepare their land for the next sowing season. Alternatives, available in the form of machines that cut and press crop stubble thereby eliminating the need for burning, still aren’t cost effective and farmers remain resistant. Consider how Punjab’s agriculture department has asked deputy commissioners to impound combine harvesters without the super straw management systems (SMS) machines. The latter are add-ons that chop paddy straw into small pieces, paving the way for the use of happy seeder machines that directly sow wheat crop without having to clear the field through burning.However, despite Punjab government offering 50% subsidy on the SMS machines, many farmers remain reluctant because attaching the system to combine harvesters increases fuel consumption by 15%. Instead, farmers are demanding a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal on paddy or compensation of Rs 6,000 per acre to help them switch to alternatives. In such a scenario, Delhi government should offer its own funds to Punjab and Haryana to incentivise their farmers to make the switch.

The UK high court decided in favour of India against Pakistan on Wednesday, making it clear that the sum — deposited in a British bank — belongs to the descendants of Hyderabad’s ruler.In 2013, Pakistan had claimed that the fund belongs to its government as the money was transferred to compensate for the weapons it provided to the ruler, seventh Nizam of Hyderabad for raising a militia, Razakars, against India. Pakistan argued that the money had been transferred to Pakistan’s high commissioner for preventing India’s annexation of Hyderabad in 1948. In other words, Pakistan admitted its involvement in the massacres committed in Hyderabad ahead of the princely state’s accession to India.The grandsons of Hyderabad’s Nizam contested Pakistan’s claim on the money and were backed by India. The UK court in its judgment said there was no evidence to suggest that the amount was given in lieu of the arms and dismissed Pakistan’s argument that Hyderabad was illegally annexed by India, pointing out that an alleged illegality was in any case irrelevant to the case.This is a defeat for Pakistan which has been harping on Partition-related issues even after more than seven decades have elapsed.

In many PoA Act cases involving verbal slurs it is often one man’s word against another — where arrest becomes excessive and even counterproductive.However, the two-judge bench’s intention of preventing misuse of a special law and violation of fundamental rights of accused was quickly overtaken by a political firestorm that dubbed the verdict anti-Dalit and anti-Adivasi.

While the restoration of a special law and the institution of new reservations achieved the task of appeasement, structural problems like the continuance of caste oppression, the false cases and low conviction rate in PoA Act cases were glossed over.The same bench had also curbed arrest provisions in IPC Section 498A that make even relatives of the husband vulnerable to arrest when a wife complains of marital cruelty. While that judgment was also overruled by a larger SC bench, the review order left the anticipatory bail provision intact and supported the expeditious hearing of bail pleas.

When rain is abundant they can neither store enough of it nor drain it properly. There is an urgent need for capacity enhancement on both fronts. This involves complex challenges like understanding the shifting flows of rivers, with huge populations already inhabiting vulnerable floodplains.

A crucial data set is the Net Enrolment Ratio (NER).

The report also looks at the percentage of out of school children mainstreamed or brought back into the schooling system. Here Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Kerala, Punjab, Bihar, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh reported a more than 10 percentage point decrease in mainstreaming.This should trigger a rethink of the scrapping of the no-detention policy by Parliament earlier this year, for it becomes harder to bring students back to school if the fear of detention hangs over their heads. On learning outcomes, the report found that average performance on the Class III language test ranged from 79% for Andhra Pradesh to 58% for UP. In mathematics, average performance ranged from 75% for Karnataka to 56% percent for Punjab. However, at Class VIII this drops to the 67%-43% range for language and 57%-31% range for mathematics across large states. This shows that as schooling years increase, learning outcomes decrease, pointing to a quality problem.For long school education in India has been given short shrift. Meanwhile, much energy has been wasted on implementing reservations at the university level because it is politically expedient. But unless school education is improved – both in terms of quality and access – the country won’t be able to inculcate the foundational skills required to create a skilled workforce.

This is because the farmer unlike the middleman is at the receiving end, irrespective of supply glut or shortfall.When prices crash or inclement weather damages crops, farm earnings take a big hit. So it is only fitting that farmers benefit from higher prices too. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen owing to kneejerk responses like export bans. The upcoming kharif harvest will start arriving in the market by end-October. The combination of export ban and imports from neighbouring countries, however, will depress prices in the short term and reduce farmers’ leverage when negotiating with agents. Export bans and setting high minimum export prices also paint India as an unreliable food supplier abroad.While governments have to be sensitive to consumer sentiment, they must choose the appropriate policy instrument to tame price rise. A seasonal spike in onion prices is a regular feature in September as the rabi stock from April-May starts depleting. Better cold storage facilities, promoting the use of dehydrated onions, releasing more NAFED buffer stocks in August-September, and urging more states to cultivate onions and diversify geographical spread would have helped.

The last three decades have seen its stunning rise to superpower status, upending global geopolitics. Its remarkable economic achievements over the last 40 years – when it lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty, became the world’s largest manufacturer, the largest trader in goods and the largest holder of foreign exchange reserves – have proven to be inspirational elsewhere in the developing world, including in India.Nevertheless, as China’s party-state system has morphed into an authoritarian technocracy, a large question mark looms over whether there is a ‘China model’ that can be replicated elsewhere. It had been hoped, especially after China joined the WTO and the international trading system in 2001, that it would gradually transform into more of an open society and cooperate more with other countries in evolving global norms and solutions. But that hasn’t happened as the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) has tightened its hold over the country, transforming it into a neo-mercantilist, hyper-nationalist power that frightens other countries.The Chinese leadership today is confident that China can regain its ancient exalted Middle Kingdom status and is not afraid to use its newfound economic and military might to create a Chinese order – which has brought it into collision with other countries even as its mercantilist/ nationalist attitude has been widely imitated. This has unfortunately contributed to a climate where nationalist claims are privileged over global coordination to solve common problems. We see this prominently in the South China Sea where Beijing is aggressively pushing its extensive maritime claims by militarising islands and building artificial ones. But we see it in the subcontinent too where Beijing undermines regional security by pursuing a narrow vision of its national interest, for example by providing diplomatic cover to Pakistan’s sponsorship of terror.The Chinese state’s growing high-tech surveillance infrastructure, including a social credit system to control social behaviour, presents a huge challenge to liberal values. What’s emerging, therefore, is a new Cold War between the liberal camp led by the West and the techno-authoritarian camp led by China. As growing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong show, the clash of values is well underway. How it shapes up could well determine the course of the rest of this century.'}]\n"

Its impact has begun to show up as an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events. In India, it is visible in the pattern of rainfall. If the evidence is overwhelming and countries are willing to set themselves national targets to limit emissions, why is international coordination on the issue difficult to achieve?Mitigation efforts, which address the causes, do have an immediate economic cost. The trade-off is tricky and everybody is not on the same page about how much price they want to pay in the present to save the world in the future. Moreover, the industrialised world appears unwilling to accept differentiated responsibilities for which, however, there is a scientific reason. Anthropogenic global warming is on account of both past and current emissions.

The idea originated in 2002 as a national identity project. Since then, successive governments have toyed with the idea even as Aadhaar emerged as a cost-effective identity system. There is no merit any longer in the smart card idea.An underlying theme in Shah’s proposition is oneness. That indeed works in some contexts – such as a common indirect tax system like GST, or a uniform civil code, or that India should work with one Constitution. But oneness cannot be a universal panacea. That would militate against one of India’s greatest strengths, its diversity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi showcased this diversity in Houston by using multiple Indian languages to say “everything is fine”. That message of diversity should be applicable inside India too. A “one size fits all” ideology is most ill-suited for its innate genius to flower.One of the highlights of the Aadhaar project is that it cost approximately $1.60 per enrollment, making it one of the least expensive in the world. A significant extent of cost saving came by avoiding a smart card. Instead of wasting time contemplating smart cards, government should work on strengthening data protection and privacy through appropriate legislation.India’s set of identifiers has evolved without adequate thought of privacy or solutions in the event of data breaches. And the one smart card idea magnifies this danger. Given the growing digitisation of everyday life, too much of integration creates a new kind of risk. Havoc can be perpetrated from a remote location. Imagine, for instance, an intelligence agency of a hostile power being able to procure all relevant details of individual Indian citizens by hacking into a single, unified database.

One of which was evident on Friday when interest rates hardened on the fear that there will be an incremental surge in government borrowing.The tax cuts are not just countercyclical in nature. India’s corporate tax rates cannot be out of sync with its peers among emerging markets. In keeping with this structural requirement, tax rates had to be revised downwards. These changes, along with others that must be undertaken to liberalise markets for factors of production, should revive private investment. However, there is generally a lag between announcements and their impact on the ground. Therefore, we need to see effective implementation of another important step to smoothen the process and make sure the tax cuts don’t elevate interest rates.The projected relative fiscal deficit for the current financial year is 3.3% of GDP. A large deviation will partially undo the potential impact of tax cuts. As government spending will not be cut, an aggressive privatisation programme is imperative. Privatisation will generate non-tax revenue and help government keep fiscal deficit in check. Privatisation should envisage not a piecemeal sale of minority stake but a full transfer of control.

It also comes at a time when Pakistan has been trying hard to drum up international support to counter India’s move to abrogate special status for Jammu & Kashmir.A fundamental plank in Pakistan’s irredentist claims on Kashmir is eliciting Western diplomatic support, chiefly in the US and UK, since it knows it cannot achieve this by military or asymmetric means alone. But the Modi-Trump bonhomie in Houston showed that Washington is firmly in India’s corner, even if some signals eventually emanate about easing restrictions in Kashmir (which New Delhi should, in any case). This was reinforced when Trump asserted the need to protect civilians from radical Islamist terrorism and Modi called out Pakistan by alluding to the fact that the planners of both the 9/11 and 26/11 terror attacks were hosted in that country.However, to take full advantage of strategic complementarities between India and the US things must improve on the trade front – it was not that long back when Trump had labelled India “tariff king”. The Trump administration’s obsession with trade deficits is a big roadblock in India-US ties. Therefore, it is hoped that the momentum from the ‘Howdy Modi’ event will translate into a meaningful trade deal. Reportedly, a mini-agreement is in the works that will see India lower tariffs on some American goods, in return for US concessions such as restoring India’s special trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences.Overall, the two countries must come together to balance the rise of a techno-totalitarian state such as China, since neither has the resources to do so alone. China has more than four times the population of the US and is close to overtaking it in GDP as well as tech prowess, while it has nearly five times the size of the Indian economy. It also happens to be driven by a sense of manifest destiny and a zero sum view of international relations. Upholding a global liberal and rules-based order, therefore, necessarily requires strong strategic cooperation between the world’s richest and largest democracy.'}]\n",

Both leaders identified terrorism as a grave danger and this is beneficial to India as it’s located in a hostile neighbourhood. The defence cooperation between the countries is picking up pace, both through bilateral exchanges and a multilateral grouping such as the Quad. Later this year, US and India are scheduled to carry out a joint tri-services military exercise.The challenging aspect of the bilateral relationship will remain trade. Ahead of bilateral trade negotiations this week, Indian public sector company Petronet updated a MoU to invest $2.5 billion in a US energy firm to secure natural gas supplies. The Trump administration has a mercantilist approach to bilateral trade and tends to view it through the prism of deficits. Combining both merchandise trade and services, US is India’s most important trade partner. Therefore, it’s essential for the Modi government to negotiate skillfully with the US as all the demands made on India are not necessarily in sync with our current economic interests.One area where India can bring about changes without hurting its own interests is in rolling back protectionist measures introduced over the last few years.

Adityanath has noted that development can reach everybody and in an equitable manner only when there is population control. UP Congress leader Jitin Prasada has chimed in claiming that the two-child norm is an old Congress agenda adopted at its famous Panchmarhi conclave in 1998.It is noteworthy that three politicians with their base in Uttar Pradesh (Modi is Varanasi MP) have spoken up. While total fertility rate (TFR) across most of the country has dipped much below replacement levels of 2.1 and India’s average TFR is just a shade higher at 2.2, UP (TFR 3.0) and Bihar (TFR 3.2) weigh the rest down. So, rather than a national population control strategy, the focus should be on UP and Bihar to bring these two outliers in range with the others. However, there must be no coercion or communal tilt. Recall that population control strategies faced a huge setback after Sanjay Gandhi’s forced nasbandhi campaigns.The discourse has gone from population explosion in the pre-liberalisation era to demographic dividend over the past two decades and again returned to population explosion, a sign of its close intertwining with growth and the economy’s ability to create jobs. An effective population control strategy would focus on education and creating awareness, making safe birth control measures accessible to the poorest, and improving socio-economic status of women. Actually, UP too has halved its fertility rate in the past four decades. It was 5.8 in 1981. Political attention will mean an added push to a demographic transition that has already kicked in.'}]\n"

In a sense, BJP dominance of the polity here echoes the national situation. Despite a lacklustre economy and visible shortcomings elsewhere, the opposition does not seem to be capable of seizing the initiative.Both Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and Haryana’s Manohar Lal Khattar are closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will remain an important factor even in these assembly elections. Their rise, in one sense, is linked to Modi’s ascendancy within BJP. As chief ministers handpicked by Modi, they go into the forthcoming elections with some positives. Neither one is weighed down by the perception of presiding over large-scale corruption. In addition, both have managed to neutralise the political challenge from dominant social groups, Marathas and Jats, who have for long had a tight grip on the chief minister’s post.On the downside, Maharashtra and Haryana are weighed down by large-scale economic problems. Rural distress, combined with frequent water scarcity in large parts of Maharashtra, has hurt both states. In addition, both states have a reasonable manufacturing base, particularly in the automobile sector, which is reeling on account of the economic slowdown. But Congress, the main challenger in both states, is in disarray. Even if the party has managed to retrieve some ground in the last couple of weeks by averting a split in Haryana and concluding a seat sharing arrangement with NCP in Maharashtra, it seems to lack the ground presence or spirit to take political advantage. It has also been undermined by recent desertions in Maharashtra.Khattar has said that his campaign in Haryana is encapsulated by the acronym SHE (security, health and education). The campaign will revolve around BJP’s strengths, which include central schemes closely associated with the prime minister. In Maharashtra the party’s challenges seem to come mainly from within such as its uneasy equation with ally Shiv Sena, which is having a hard time coming to terms with becoming a junior partner.

It’s a bold step that seeks to unleash animal spirits by boosting sentiments, in an economy weighed down by weak aggregate demand. The new tax rates are optional. Companies can shift to it provided they forego all tax exemptions. Consequently, government avoided a mid-year disruption but provided a roadmap. Along with tax rate cuts, enhanced surcharges introduced in the budget on capital gains have been rolled back.The cut in headline rates for existing companies and an even lower rate of 15% for fresh investment in manufacturing represent a fiscal stimulus; it may lead to Rs 1.45 trillion of revenue foregone. However, the announcement should also been seen as a structural change. India needs to compete with Asian emerging markets for investment. At 22%, the headline rate is between that of Vietnam and Indonesia. The move had a mixed impact on capital markets. Stock indices surged but so did interest rates on debt as the fiscal deficit is likely to widen. However, the step is the right one as a big announcement was needed to change the mood and yield better revenues in the medium term.Bringing in surcharges and cess, the effective corporate tax rate today is about 25.17%. There is a stark difference between corporate tax rate and the top marginal tax rate of almost 43% for personal income. Given that private consumption growth is trailing overall GDP growth, the effort to boost demand must encompass a cut in personal tax rates. It will complement today’s announcement and cost far less in terms of revenue foregone. The combined impact of corporate and personal tax cuts, aided by RBI’s monetary loosening, may be the booster needed to reverse the 18 month long loss of economic momentum.

It has claimed that the postmortem, medical and forensic opinion that stated the cause of death as cardiac arrest wasn’t clear enough to slap murder charges in the first chargesheet.

Yet the similarities with the Pehlu Khan lynching probe in faraway Rajasthan where all the accused were acquitted raises worries about the Ansari case. In the Pehlu lynching too, a video nailed the accused yet the investigation was muddled and two sets of doctors presented differing medical opinions.

She had tough words for them: Listen to the scientists, unite behind the science, then take real action.One poll has found that as many as a quarter of American teens are engaged in climate activism. It’s a generation very alive to the impact of climate change on their lives and their future. It also has a feeling of having been betrayed by the previous generations, by baby boomers who burdened their descendants both with their social security bills and a warming planet, selfishly doing nothing to rein in either ballooning debt or climatic dangers.Don’t bring a speech, bring a plan: the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres’s advice to nations readying to join the UN climate action summit on Monday, echoes Thunberg. The kind of international cooperation that is needed to tackle global problems today, has receded with a rising tide of populist nationalism. One example is how rich countries have not lived up to the Paris Agreement commitment to mobilise $100 billion to help the developing world.

Recent years have seen a sustained policy push for renewables. There has been a long term effort to protect the forest cover that acts as a carbon sink. Unfortunately, populist nationalism has been taking a big toll here too.

Bans can simply push a product underground.Ultimately it comes down to good regulations and consciousness-raising, which have been helping bring down overall tobacco use in India.

This step is a part of the overarching goal to eliminate SUP by 2022. There is an irrefutable case in favour of getting rid of SUP, which are used just once before they are discarded. More than a dozen states over the last decade have tried to eliminate SUP. The next step therefore should be to carefully sift the results to find the most effective way forward.Plastics are a miracle material, popular across industries for their properties. The flip side to this material’s durability is the difficulty of disposing it, resulting in some of the worst forms of environmental damage. India generates about 9.4 million tons of plastic waste a year, and recycles about 60% of it. India’s recycling record is impressive when measured by the global average. However, our challenge is a rapid incremental accumulation of plastic waste on account of the popularity of SUP.Globally, a combination of bans and economic incentives have been used to eliminate SUP. India favours bans. Therefore, a look at Bangladesh’s experience with a ban is helpful. The country imposed a ban in 2002 and public awareness of the problem is high. Yet, UN believes the policy failed because of lack of alternatives to plastic. At home, Tamil Nadu’s experiment with a ban since the beginning of the year is facing a similar challenge. The Modi government is yet to unveil a comprehensive solution to eliminate SUP. It should first think through how it wants to actualise its goal. It’s unwise to precipitate disruption even in the pursuit of a worthy goal.Experience teaches us that a durable solution will have to incorporate economic incentives to eliminate SUP. Governments should continue to initiate and support all efforts at raising consciousness on the damaging impact of SUP. But if heightened awareness is to quickly translate into a ground level impact, fiscal incentives to encourage early adoption of alternatives are necessary. Plastics are popular because of their benefits. Therefore, a successful campaign against it has to be underpinned by creation of a market for alternative materials which don’t have the same impact on the environment. The upfront fiscal incentives for it will repay itself manifold through a cleaner environment and better quality of life.'}]\n"

What has been a grey area is under exactly what provisions these leaders have been detained. In Farooq’s case , Rajya Sabha MP and MDMK leader Vaiko brought the matter to the Supreme Court by filing a writ of habeas corpus, questioning the arrest of “democratically elected representatives who were instrumental in strengthening democracy in the state”.The PSA that has since been invoked is a draconian legislation, where a person can be detained without a formal charge or trial for up to two years. Such suspension of individual liberty is justifiable only in extreme cases. Unfortunately, the law has been widely invoked despite the Srinagar bench of J&K high court questioning the grounds for arrest in many cases and ordering the release of detainees. Using it against Kashmir’s most senior political leader is very different from using it against suspected militants and insurgents.At the turn of the century, Farooq’s chief ministership was instrumental in turning the tide against the Kashmir insurgency. Detaining him indefinitely will discourage a new generation of politicians from rising to restore normalcy in the Valley. Moreover, as BJP celebrates the extinction of J&K’s ‘special status’, it should also take concurrent steps towards normalising the situation in J&K by doing away with its ‘special’ laws that violate the spirit of the Constitution and the ‘right to life and liberty’ enshrined in it – such as PSA.

BJP’s Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has declared that all official languages are equal and there will be no compromise on the importance of Kannada. Similarly, BJP ally AIADMK has asserted that Tamil Nadu will stick to Tamil and English. The language issue has an old, emotive history in the country. The Constitution already treats Hindi as the official language of the Union and gives states the freedom to legislate their own official languages. Additionally 22 languages – including Hindi – are recognised in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.The concept of a one-language nation to foster unity among the people is a construct of 19th century European nationalism, which became outmoded in the 20th century itself. And in the 21st century, technology is bringing down language barriers in any case. Recent history also offers many instances of the pitfalls of imposing a language on people with a different mother tongue. We have already witnessed strong anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu in 1965, which stymied the imposition of Hindi. And in neighbouring Bangladesh – then East Pakistan – the language movement against the imposition of Urdu on Bengali speakers was a key driver of Pakistan splitting into two nations.Moreover, there are better ways to foster national unity than imposing a language. Having a single, simplified tax structure creating a common market for the country, or fostering a single labour market are far better ways of practically integrating the country as well as boosting the economy. Nativist onslaughts on English too are counterproductive, given that the language is linked to India’s successes in modern sectors such as IT. Restarting language wars won’t help the nation in any way.'}]\n",

In response, oil prices increased 20% on Monday in intraday trading, the largest such gain since the 1991 Gulf War.These developments will have an adverse impact on India. There will not be an immediate fallout on energy prices as India’s strategic oil reserve stocks along with inventory held by oil refiners provides a buffer of almost three months. But the uncertainty will show up in financial markets. Also, if political tensions worsen, the impact on oil prices may last. It couldn’t have come at a worse time as we are in the midst of a pronounced slowdown in aggregate demand. Not only has investment been weak for a few years, even consumption growth is losing momentum.Crude price is a factor beyond the control of government. However, there are other factors within the economy which can be improved. One of the highlights of India’s economic performance over the last few years is a durable reduction in the rate of inflation. A softening of crude price has contributed to it; this will be under threat if the geopolitical situation in West Asia deteriorates. If crude prices do harden and stay at elevated levels, there is a strong economic case to lower elevated taxes on retail petro products to ensure consumption demand is not dampened further.The most important lesson which the government needs to draw from this episode is that it’s essential to focus on the economy. It cannot afford to fritter away its enormous political capital on socially divisive issues. Fast-paced growth will create conditions which will overcome many of India’s economic as well as societal challenges. It will also provide space for India to pursue its larger strategic goals. The window for economic reforms provided by low oil prices may not last long.

However, the advance notice for the odd-even scheme, implemented twice in 2016 and then abandoned, is surprising. For one, there is no agreement among experts on the scheme’s efficacy despite its disruption of normal traffic.Second, Delhi-NCR’s Graded Response Action Plan lists this as an “emergency” measure to be rolled out only when PM2.5/PM10 concentration crosses “Severe+” levels of 300/500 µg/m3 respectively. Deploying a last-line measure as a default pollution control strategy doesn’t speak well of public policy. There was much Delhi government could have learnt from the scheme’s first two editions. In areas not serviced by the Delhi metro, the absence of buses were keenly felt. Delhi’s DTC bus fleet has shrunk from a high of 6,329 in 2010 to a decadal low of 3,781 today. This statistic does not inspire confidence in the city government’s zeal to tackle pollution.An odd-even scheme is no substitute for better governance which would have ensured more buses on roads, better pollution compliance by vehicles, and improved coordination with neighbouring states. Token gestures which grab attention in election season and unabashed populism like distributing free N95 masks distract from the causes of winter pollution spikes in north India. Stubble burning and Diwali firecrackers are clear man-made contributors to the toxic mix with no economic/ environmental/ public health rationale for continuing these practices – unlike, say, driving a vehicle to work.Attempts to wean people away from firecrackers by awareness campaigns fronted by celebrities or the Delhi government’s proposed laser-shows on Diwali eve can help. Even the plan to sanitise 12 local pollution hotspots in Delhi holds promise. Centre also has a key role to play in curbing stubble burning by incentivising happy seeder machines and egging Punjab and Haryana governments to shore up their monitoring mechanisms.

Gujarat this week reduced some of the fines set by the Centre on humanitarian grounds. The overarching aim of the amendments has wide support. Given that India has a shameful record of fatalities on account of road accidents, even when compared to other developing countries, some of the measures in the amendments, particularly the one relating to encouraging good Samaritans, are welcome. The debate is over a steep hike in fines. For example, the penalty for jumping a traffic light has gone from Rs 100 to Rs 5,000. Will a harsh measure be the game changer?The record across the world is decidedly mixed but fine remains a popular tool, with Finland going so far as to link it to a violator’s disposable income. What is unambiguous is that the problem of fatalities is more pronounced in the developing world, which WHO says accounts for 93% of fatalities with around 60% of vehicles. Richer countries have created safer roads over the last four decades. There are two solutions and both are needed. One, is to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement framework. Two, significantly improve road design in India which is also a cause of fatalities.Will stiff fines improve driving habits? Yes, if the violator is fairly sure that it’s difficult to escape. However, enforcement has been India’s weakness. Once the current fuss dies, our record suggests it will be business as usual. It may also encourage petty corruption. Therefore, instead of fixing fines at a level where even a relatively wealthy BJP-administered state feels pressured to lower it, focus on consistent enforcement. A model where most fines escalate with repeat offences with the possibility of flying below the radar minimised is the way forward.Technology today provides a cost effective solution to implement this model. For example, with a higher density of working CCTVs states can automate enforcement. If such solutions start in the biggest urban centres and key highways of every state, there will be an early impact and fatalities will reduce. No one condones violations.

That said, the UN Human Rights Council needs to be uniform, consistent and even-handed when it comes to human rights abuse or denial of civil rights to people across the world.

In Kech district of Balochistan, the Internet has been shut down for the last two years for security concerns.

Perhaps something similar could be said about the India story, which had risen dramatically over the last decade but no longer attracts so much attention. Investments and savings have soured, the bad loan problem remains, now consumption and demand are collapsing (as unprecedented declines in the bellwether auto sector indicate). GDP growth declined for five successive quarters and hit a low of 5% in the last April-June quarter. As foreign companies ship out of China due to enhanced US tariffs, they are relocating to countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico and Bangladesh while India receives little benefit.While the Modi government has made bold moves on the foreign policy, security and political fronts, economic policy has been marked by excessive caution, incrementalism and empowerment of the bureaucracy rather than markets. This has led to a paradox. As an example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed the international repercussions of the nullification of Article 370 in J&K deftly, while balancing great power relationships with successful meetings with Presidents Macron, Trump and Putin within the last three weeks. But diplomatic heft also comes from economic growth, on which New Delhi is slipping.Alongside Hindutva excesses, widespread lynchings, the NRC fiasco where there is talk about detaining millions in Assam even as the government considers extending NRC to other states, do not cumulatively give rise to a pretty picture. They may constitute the surround sound which explains why the 370 decision, even if inherently justifiable, was in general received negatively in the Western press. India is known as a land of many colours, and any undermining of that reputation will negatively impact its soft power. This amounts to a double whammy, as the economy’s engines failing to fire indicates a decline in hard power as well.In this context, excessive sound and fury in claiming government achievements could come in the way of taking necessary corrective steps and thus prove to be counterproductive. However, by calling for a $5 trillion economy by 2024, Modi proclaimed the right target. And the government can call on enough economic experts who can tell us how to get there. Listen to them, rather than getting bureaucrats to craft economic policy. Have the political courage to take bold reform measures. And yes, social inclusiveness would help too.'}]\n",

US President Donald Trump reportedly took the decision after Taliban claimed responsibility for a recent attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier. Backchannel negotiations between the US and Afghan Islamists had been going on since late last year. And in recent weeks the two sides had hinted at a framework peace deal that entailed the US effecting a partial pullout of troops and vacating three Afghan bases in exchange for Taliban’s promise to sever ties with al-Qaida and not allow Afghan soil to be used for attacks against the US and its allies.However, the talks bore the characteristics of a surrender negotiation. After all, Taliban have refused to cede an inch. They continue to reject any formal talks with the elected Afghan government and made no pretence of scaling back violence during dialogue with the American envoy. Taliban, having fought American-led forces for 18 years, are confident it is only a matter of time before the Americans leave. And Trump since last year has insisted that US military presence in Afghanistan must end.What makes Taliban so strong is Pakistan which provides the militants safe haven on its soil. This factor is also what buoys the Kashmir insurgency and may have prompted New Delhi’s decision to nullify Article 370. As long as this arrangement remains and Islamabad continues to view Afghanistan as providing strategic depth, there’s little chance that Washington will get a peace deal that enables an orderly end to the war. The US needs to crack down on Pakistan’s support for Taliban if it is to acquire a position of strength in Afghan negotiations.'}]\n"

However, looks increasingly unlikely in the face of numerous terror attacks that the Taliban perpetrated against not just the US security forces but Afghan civilians too even as the dialogue process was on and about to reach an agreement. Just last week in Kabul, the Taliban killed 12 people including a US soldier.The Taliban’s continual terror attacks, killing hundreds of Afghans including children, only to strengthen its bargaining position in the negotiations with the Trump administration, has been a clear indicator that the Islamist militant organization cannot be relied on to keep peace once the US troops withdraw.President Trump had also shown lack of diplomatic prudence by holding talks with the Taliban directly, overlooking the concerns and feedback of the Afghan government by Ashraf Ghani. The secret meeting that the US was to hold with Taliban leaders at Camp David, would have been disastrous without simultaneous presence at the table of Afghan government representatives too.The US has done well by reconsidering its position given that its last withdrawal from Afghanistan after defeating the Soviet Union, led to the Pakistan-backed Taliban taking over the country. That eventually paved the way for al-Qaida to set up its base in Afghanistan and perpetrate the 9/11 terror attacks in the US.

Already, on the issue of Article 370 the support to the government from many Hindi heartland politicians of the Congress reveals how a divergence in party positions is sharpening even along a geographic axis.Before the Lok Sabha elections in which Congress was again blanked out in north India the party had notched wins in three Hindi heartland states and ran BJP close in Gujarat. In Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, Congress leaders visited temples and promised various gau seva measures. It is unclear how much anti-incumbency against BJP and how much soft Hindutva helped Congress do better in those elections.Yet secularism is not a lost cause. Congress can still make a fight of it by correcting old mistakes. For one, it can come out in favour of Uniform Civil Code instead of worrying incessantly about backlash from conservative Muslim clergy. Secondly, it needs to highlight how only a secular India can make progress in the socio-economic domain — a point easier to make with the ongoing economic slump.

The last stages of the six week journey to the lunar surface were a riveting watch. Eventually, Isro lost communication with the lander (Vikram) a mere 2.1 km from the surface. But it would be inaccurate to label this mission a failure. The orbiter, one of three parts of the Chandrayaan-2 stack, continues to function. Over the next few years, this orbiter will keep sending back pictures that will form the basis of subsequent analysis.The sight of Isro’s chairman K Sivan breaking down after the lander lost contact with the ground stations and Prime Minister Narendra Modi consoling him encapsulated the trials and tribulations of a remarkable institution. Against odds, Isro has made the small global space fraternity sit up and take notice. Run on a tight budget, with a church in a fishing village in Kerala serving as the main office for scientists in the 1960s, Isro has constantly evolved, taking on tougher challenges. Chandrayaan-2, its second moon mission, was more complex than even the Mars Orbiter Mission.The run-up to Chandrayaan-2 mission was not smooth. A proposed Russian collaboration did not work out. With hindsight, this worked well for Isro as it had to strengthen its capabilities for the mission. The timing of the moon mission is ideal because globally moon landings have begun to evince more interest. Nasa has announced that the US will take greater interest through its Artemis Moon programme next year. An attempt by an Israeli team earlier this year did not meet with success during the landing stage. South Korea is expected to soon join the race to land on the lunar surface.Given this context, Isro needs to use the knowledge gained from Chandrayaan-2 mission to build on its early success. The launch vehicle, GSLV MkIII-M1 in this case, needs to be enhanced to carry heavier loads. In the original plan for Chandrayaan-2, the lander and rover (Pragyan) would have functioned for one lunar day, equivalent to 14 earth days. Isro now needs to improve on this count by using radioactive heater units to last through a lunar night, something the Chinese have successfully done.

Delhi and Mumbai have added infrastructure like roads, public transport and housing but the idea of a liveable city encompasses a lot more than just ceaseless (sometimes pointless) construction activity. Take Mumbai where heavy rainfall on Wednesday has drowned and shut down the city. Widely billed as Asia’s richest municipal body, Mumbai’s BMC is heavily politicised and incapable of meeting public pressure to reform.Delhi’s drop by six places in the liveability index has been attributed to drop in its environment, culture and safety scores. Even while offering a global perspective, this fall starkly captures Delhi’s local lived reality. Petty crimes are mushrooming again and Delhi Police have squarely failed to tackle the biker gangs committing roadside robberies. A shocking case this week typifies the antiquated methods still in vogue. A senior citizen was murdered by his domestic help with the much vaunted police verification of domestic workers restricted to the thana level, failing to catch the crimes committed by the help at two nearby police stations.Policing of large metropolitan cities cannot afford to be so myopic. India needs to approach urban local government differently. State governments have centralised too much authority and devolve too little power and funds to municipal corporations. Consequently, civic bodies and town planners lack the capacity to handle rapid urbanisation. The spurt of slums and landfills, encroachment on public land, non-existent drainage, groundwater exploitation, and clogged roads can all be traced to weak municipal corporations.Mumbai and Delhi are the two Indian cities measured by World Bank for its influential ease of doing business index. Foreign investors tend to be chary about cities showing regression in a key area like liveability. When government finally gets going on the next generation of economic reforms, it must untangle municipal governance which holds back Indian cities from realising their potential. State governments must also cooperate. For example, Maharashtra politicians do little to reform BMC.

After relentless demonstrations by young Hongkongers, the city administration agreed to their main demand. However, protesters want their other demands – including an independent inquiry into police brutality and direct democratic elections – to be fulfilled as well.At the heart of the Hong Kong unrest lies a clash of ideas. Hongkongers still adhere to democratic, liberal values they inherited from the British. When Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, it was far more prosperous than any other region of China and accrued several economic advantages to Beijing. However, China’s meteoric growth over the last two decades has meant that those advantages have decreased over time – although they still exist – and Hong Kong is no longer seen as special by Beijing. The latter has since proceeded to slowly erode Hong Kong’s separate political mechanism. The protests today are a pushback against those designs.What happens in Hong Kong is of special interest in India. It is something of a mystery, for example, why China consistently sides with Pakistan against India in any dispute, and attempts otherwise to block India’s rise, when India offers far more commercial opportunities to China than Pakistan does. The most plausible answer to this conundrum is that India is a functioning democracy, and China fears its ‘contagion’ effect. Something similar could be said of Hong Kong as well.

Transparency in benchmarks is welcome. However, if borrowers are to derive the entire benefit other changes are needed.Banks are intermediaries, who raise deposits and then lend them at a higher rate. The reluctance on their part to shift to a completely flexible lending rate is on account of the inflexibility in deposit rates. Deposit rates are typically at fixed rates as savers seem to prefer stability. Borrowers are more inclined to opt for floating rates. It’s this mismatch which created a structural barrier to an earlier shift to a system where most interest rates are quickly readjusted. This structural barrier remains. Consequently, banks may hereafter increase the spread, or premium, over the benchmark rate to offset higher risks. If that is to be avoided so that borrowers get the full benefit of this change, deposit rates need to be more flexible.RBI has to take the initiative.

Arrest on this account is what CBI took recourse to in the case of former finance minister P Chidambaram. The charges are serious and the law must take its course.However, given the political backdrop, there’s also scope for a larger debate on issues of political funding that Shivakumar’s case, in particular, raises. It’s exceedingly curious that agencies find suspicious activity only in the case of opposition members. A highlight of Shivakumar’s political career is his association with resort politics. He has been the go-to man for his party units in several states when the loyalties of their legislators are suspect. Given that resort politics was at the heart of BJP’s recent comeback in Karnataka, these events foreground the nature of political funding in India. On this matter, unanimity prevails among political parties. There is no effort among major political parties to clean up. If anything, the situation has deteriorated.Parties justifiably ask for an expansion in unrealistic election spending limits. Their demand, however, will carry greater credibility if there is a simultaneous effort to clean up funding sources and make them transparent. Instead, NDA introduced the insidious electoral bonds scheme, which removed even a modicum of transparency in the sourcing of political funds. At the same time restrictions on foreign funding of political parties were loosened, when other democracies ban such funding. Indian democracy’s regression in cleaning up political funding erodes the credibility of the entire system.An intriguing aspect of Shivakumar’s arrest is that his plight elicited sympathy even among BJP members in Karnataka, including chief minister BS Yeddyurappa. However, vandalism and the enforcement of bandhs by Shivakumar’s supporters are unsupportable. Congress leaders should take the initiative to restrain them. At the same time agencies must be even-handed, and be seen to be so, when investigating economic crimes.

One presumes, therefore, that Khan’s statement was made for the sake of optics – as the occasion was the first international Sikh convention in Lahore.Nevertheless, declaring no first use would certainly go a long way towards revising Pakistan’s unsavoury international reputation – which also happens to be the kiss of death for the Kashmir “cause” it champions – for the better.

Indeed, in an oped published by the New York Times, Khan argues that a nuclear conflict in south Asia will have consequences for the whole world, if it doesn’t heed Pakistan’s narrative on Kashmir. Since India will not use nuclear weapons first, the catastrophic nuclear exchange Khan envisions can only be initiated by Pakistan.This is thus a thoroughly duplicitous argument, in line with the Pakistani strategy of using a nuclear umbrella to pursue sub-conventional warfare against India.

It’s that sort of argument that leads to the perception of Pakistan as an irresponsible, double-dealing power, in former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright’s words an “international migraine”. However, by declaring no first use, Pakistan would at one stroke transform its image into that of a responsible nuclear power.

In the Shahjahanpur case the accused is former central minister and BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand. And although the law student is no longer missing, it remains to be seen whether state authorities will address her allegations of sexual harassment justly.A good benchmark for judging governance in a state is how it responds to dissent and criticism – which can help it identify gaps in delivery and fix them. But if the primary focus is on silencing critics, it means that the failures of the state will endure rather than end. Likewise, when the ordinary citizen goes up against someone powerful, if the arms of the state ring-fence the latter at the expense of the former this too performs a silencing function. The message goes to other aggrieved citizens to swallow their complaints – no matter how grave.Isn’t this the message that has been sent out in Mirzapur too? UP police have registered a case of criminal conspiracy against journalist Pawan Jaiswal, after his video showing students at a state-run school having just roti with salt as their midday meal went viral. Midday meal schemes fight malnutrition. They raise school attendance and lower caste barriers. Given this triple whammy developmental effect governments must go all out to ensure midday meals work well.

That an Indian fast bowler awed West Indian fans is a particularly satisfying moment as Jamaica is where 43 years ago hostile fast bowling sent bloodied Indian batsmen straight from the field to an infirmary. As Indian fans savour this moment, they should also understand that Bumrah is not an accident. He represents the outcome of a system geared to nurture talent.To put it in proper context, one of the most significant recent developments in cricket is the decline of fast bowling in Pakistan and West Indies. In the 1980s and early 1990s, they were dominant.However, that dominance was the by-product of the institutional excellence of English county cricket. To illustrate, Imran Khan was almost entirely the product of the English system. England helped these countries overcome weak domestic structures. Once it became harder for them to get to England, decline was inevitable in the absence of improvements at home.India, on the other hand, managed to create a domestic system that’s robust to some extent — sometimes entirely reliant on private initiative such as MRF Pace Foundation — to nurture talent. Even the much maligned IPL played an important role in nurturing fast bowlers.

This concern will get amplified during a phase of prolonged slowdown in economic growth.The belated release of the Period Labour Force Survey, or jobs data, revealed a disturbing trend. It’s not so much open unemployment of 6.1%, a steady decline in working age population in the job market is a bigger challenge. In 2017-18, a little less than half the working age population was in the job market – noticeably lower than the proportion during the previous survey (2011-12). There may be valid explanations such as young people spending a longer time in formal education. But there is evidence to suggest such explanations don’t tell the entire story.India’s struggle to foster an environment where quality jobs are created happens to coincide with its period of demographic dividend. It is therefore absolutely essential to get the economy right to ensure that we don’t end up with a demographic nightmare – whose possibility, however, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared to concede in his Independence Day speech last month when he expressed concern about a “population explosion”. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman deserves credit for her willingness to engage industry and other stakeholders over the last few weeks. The outcome, however, should be a holistic approach to removing growth bottlenecks and making India globally competitive, rather than a Band Aid approach to sectoral issues.To illustrate, frontloading recapitalisation of banks and their mergers have potential benefits.

The latter, however, also voted against a no-deal Brexit as this would cause much chaos for people and British businesses. Then there is the issue of the Irish backstop, a provision of the current withdrawal agreement that is aimed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The backstop kicks in if at the end of the transition period till December 2022, the UK and EU fail to negotiate a post-Brexit permanent trade deal that keeps the Irish border open. This would entail the UK entering a temporary single customs territory with EU and Northern Ireland would stay aligned to EU single market rules.That is unacceptable to Johnson.

The reason banks are being provided more capital at a time when economic growth has dipped to its lowest point in six years is that they failed to do things right in the first place. Public sector banks (PSBs) have been burdened for over five years by the weight of bad loans. This problem has rippled out to the rest of the economy.\\xa0The mergers and consequent growth in size does have positive aspects. However, in the absence of governance reforms within banks, it may lead to bigger problems than now. If size gives a bank cushion and opens up opportunities, they also become “too big to fail” and chances are that successive governments will become committed to bailing them out permanently with huge tranches of taxpayer’s money. Therefore, the merger by itself cannot be the reform the financial sector needs. The real reform that is needed is improvement in the governance system of banks and an enhancement in PSBs’ credit appraisal system, not continuing with business as usual.Governance reforms in PSBs have been held back by government’s majority stake in them.

Localised measures like rolling out cleaner BS-VI fuels, shutting down thermal power plants, opening new highways to bypass Delhi and other dust control norms helped achieve this fall. While Delhi’s limited success highlights what other cities must do, the very nature of air and wind movement that allows it to diffuse far and wide makes air pollution a problem that respects no city, state or national boundaries.There are gaps in incentivising happy seeder machines which can stop the damaging paddy stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh after the kharif season in October.

Such comments are highly irresponsible and show that vested political interests want to keep the foreigners issue alive in Assam.NRC was meant to be a one-time exercise with massive resources devoted to it. The truth is it has been a mess, making it hard to comprehend why BJP wants to repeat it in other states. It has created hardships and anxieties for millions of people.

This will be accompanied by governance reforms in banks to enhance their performance. If this does come through, it will address weakness in one factor of production to some extent. Structural reforms require deep commitment and the pay-off takes a while to show up. They remain indispensable. But the current slowdown also has a cyclical component. It has been addressed by RBI through an interest reduction cycle, backed by easing of liquidity constraints. A countercyclical package works best if fiscal and monetary policy are in sync.

FDI restriction in coal mining has for long been emblematic of vested interests and warped thinking. Consequently, long after 100% FDI was allowed in exploration and production in petroleum sector, coal remained a no-go area for foreign investment.Coherence, however, is largely missing from the overall approach to economic policy at both Centre and states. Discredited ideas drive economic policy – making us very good at the one step forward, two steps back routine. While some obstacles to investment are removed, new ones are added. To illustrate, government is reported to be working to bring hygiene products such as sanitary pads within the universe of healthcare items where prices are controlled. It seems to have escaped the notice of governments in India that prosperous countries use markets and competition, rather than price controls, to ensure consumers get quality products at reasonable prices.Price controls are not the only dampener to investment. The Delhi government recently unveiled another favourite tool: taking recourse to bizarre and whimsical regulations that make doing business difficult and expand the inspector raj. These will now require hotels and restaurants to destroy any alcohol lying with them for more than eight days. The underlying approach of governments is that they are economically all-seeing and omniscient, while all other economic actors are untrustworthy. Therefore, it’s no surprise that in relative terms India’s performance in foreign investment has deteriorated over time. In 2007-08, foreign investment as a proportion of GDP was around 5%. At present, it fluctuates between 2.2% to 2.4%.The steps to liberalise FDI are indeed welcome. However, if these steps are to translate into their full potential, they need to be a part of a larger change in policy and mindset. For example, FDI loosening for contract manufacturing needs to be accompanied by changes in labour and land markets to allow for greater flexibility. Investment decisions are influenced by a wide array of factors, which calls for a holistic approach to reform. A reform package should include tax architecture.

The spectre of mobs running amok imperils our very way of life. It also puts at risk India’s reputation as a tourist and business destination. Given the seriousness of this threat the court had asked Parliament to enact a separate offence for lynching. So far the Centre appears to be of the opinion that better enforcement of existing laws will suffice instead. But states are beginning to pass anti-lynching laws.In December the Manipur assembly passed a bill recommending life imprisonment for those involved in mob violence, if it resulted in the death of a person. Earlier this month Rajasthan assembly passed a bill making mob lynching a non-bailable offence punishable with life imprisonment and a fine up to Rs 5 lakh. The proposed Bengal law, alongside punitive measures, has humane features like witness protection and compensation for victims.A look at what happened this week in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, underlines how much the cancer has spread. Last December inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was killed in a shocking attack on police by a mob protesting alleged cow slaughter. When seven persons accused of killing him came out on bail, they were given a hero’s welcome, slogans of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ were raised in their honour. In the cops vs vigilantes battle, this suggests how much the forces of law and order are weakened and mobs empowered.While new anti-lynching laws hold hope, the law can only be a tool and not a magic bullet. And a tool works only as well as it is wielded. On Independence Day eve six men accused of lynching Pehlu Khan were acquitted, because of a series of investigative and prosecutorial failures. Laws can be misused too. For example the proposed Bengal anti-lynching law has a provision to punish people for disseminating offensive material, which could be deployed for political witch hunts.

Delhiites who haven’t been paying their water bills can now do so at a heavy discount and with a total waiver on late payment surcharge. In lower-end localities this will translate into 100% waiver of past dues for domestic users till March this year. Kejriwal has defended the move on the ground that it will help clean up Delhi Jal Board books. But the signal it sends to people is a wrong one.At a time when most Indian cities are grappling with a shortage of water supply, such freebies do great harm to water sustainability. An impression gets created that people can afford to not pay for water as the bills will be waived off come election season. Consumer behaviour is extremely critical to water conservation. But the Delhi government’s move incentivises water wastage and irresponsibility among the public. This, despite the fact that in seven out of the 10 most populous cities in India the depth to groundwater has increased significantly over the last two decades. In Delhi, the depth has nearly doubled.Read also: ‘Water arrears of those having functional domestic metres in four Delhi colonies to be waived off’It would have made sense if the water bill waivers had been tied to conservation efforts such as rain water harvesting.

It’s based on risk analysis and should put an end to an unseemly controversy over RBI’s reserves. The backstory is that a committee under the chairmanship of former RBI governor Bimal Jalan was set up to work out a transparent method to determine the reserves RBI should hold. The windfall is the outcome of the Jalan committee’s conclusion.RBI’s balance sheet needs to reflect its statutory mandate of containing inflation and maintaining financial stability. Hence, provisions it sets aside are a buffer for a ‘rainy day’. Even prior to the Jalan committee’s conclusion, RBI’s reserves were based on an expert committee’s recommendations. Which is why the controversy over its reserves had no basis and comparisons with other central banks are meaningless on account of dissimilar mandates and risks. The Jalan committee’s analysis is based on RBI’s current mandate. It concluded that RBI should maintain a Contingent Risk Buffer in a range of 5.5%-6.5% of its balance sheet.Once the RBI board accepted this recommendation, the windfall followed. Partially linked to the recommendations is the annual surplus of Rs 1.23 trillion the central bank transferred to government. Other than the Jalan committee’s formula, the annual surplus is influenced by the interest RBI earned on the government securities and foreign assets it holds. The aggregate amount, Rs 1.76 trillion, government has received from RBI in 2018-19 is indeed more than what it accounted for in the budget. To that extent, it eases the fiscal pressure it has been under on account of a marked economic slowdown.The nature of RBI’s balance sheet and its role in money supply makes the transfer relatively insignificant in terms of its overall impact on economic momentum. However, by easing the fiscal pressure on government it may have unintended benefits such as mitigating the temptation to push the income tax department to meet unrealistic revenue targets. The bottom line however remains unchanged. India’s economy has weakened in the last few years. To reverse this trend and bring ‘animal spirits’ back, government needs to unleash a new round of reforms which encompass factors of production such as land, labour and capital.

In the press conference by both leaders, Trump reported that Modi felt he had the Kashmir situation under control and expressed confidence in New Delhi’s ability to “do something that will be very good” by speaking with Pakistan – in other words, support for the Indian position that disputes with Pakistan can be resolved bilaterally, and a shift from his previous pitch to mediate in the “explosive” Kashmir dispute.Modi reinforced that message by shrugging off Islamabad’s attempts to transform Kashmir into an international crisis and paint New Delhi into a diplomatic corner over it. He said there are many issues with Pakistan that are bilateral and New Delhi doesn’t bother other countries about these as solutions could be found through bilateral discussions. He also shifted the discourse away from themes that Pakistan would like to emphasise, by reiterating how India and Pakistan should fight poverty and illiteracy together.Modi has also gotten Gulf Muslim nations such as UAE and Bahrain – countries that Islamabad sees as its benefactors – to back India’s position. The latter was exemplified by the fact that Modi received UAE’s highest civilian award, Order of Zayed, and was conferred the King Hamad Order of the Renaissance by Bahrain ahead of the G7 Summit. Even as Islamabad showcases itself as a one-issue country, Modi addresses the G7 on pressing global issues of the day such as climate change and digital economy. That ought to be New Delhi’s order of priority. While Kashmir is indeed an important issue in a domestic frame, it doesn’t rank that high among global priorities – Islamabad will only succeed in isolating itself with radical and intemperate rhetoric on Kashmir. Of course, New Delhi also needs to handle the current situation in Kashmir sensitively.That said, the fact that the US needs to withdraw from Afghanistan means Pakistan still has leverage with Trump.

His network of personal relationships across party lines stood out, extending his political influence much beyond BJP. This has withstood even today’s partisan political atmosphere, and was evident in the heartfelt accolades pouring in from opposition leaders since Saturday.An accomplished lawyer who served as additional solicitor general 30 years ago, Jaitley’s interests spanned many areas including food and cricket. He was a man of conviction, evident when he threw himself into the struggle for democracy during the Emergency years, and was jailed for 19 months. Known for his human qualities, he was a man of large sympathies and generous to a fault. As a liberal within BJP, he was an exemplar of the notion that this combination of qualities – of liberal values together with largeness of heart – is essential to uphold and sustain India’s democratic traditions.As a young minister in the Vajpayee government, Jaitley handled critical portfolios such as disinvestment and law and justice. During Modi’s first term, his skills found best use both as finance and defence minister. He played a critical role in ushering in the two big Modi-era economic reforms – GST and the Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, Jaitley’s acute understanding of the trajectory of India’s constitutional architecture showed up in the lucid manner in which he unpacked its essence.He pointed out on multiple occasions that the Constitution gave pre-eminence to the right to free speech, and understood that unnecessary obstacles to the business of running a newspaper – whether financial, legal or otherwise – impeded that right. He helped drive this home in the Supreme Court in the Express Newspapers v Union of India case, that ultimately such obstacles endanger the independence of media. His argument was vindicated when the apex court blocked the demolition of Express Building, the newspaper group’s headquarters in Delhi. Jaitley will certainly be missed, across parties and beyond.

As solution, the government has offered a fiscal concession in terms of depreciation rates and also suspended a proposed increase in registration fees of vehicles. The attempt to provide clarity on emission standards regulations is significant. Investments are unlikely to happen in an uncertain environment.

Another change proposed is a front loading of the budget proposal to recapitalise banks.Economic sentiment turned negative after the budget partly on account of enhanced tax surcharge on capital gains and foreign portfolio investors. Both have been withdrawn, which should undo some damage. The government will also back down on a draconian proposal to criminalise CSR violations.

If these conditions persist, victory in war will only come at huge costs. The IAF’s hardware woes are due to a combination of ageing aircraft, tardy pace of indigenisation and slow induction of foreign imports. Even the 36 Rafale jets being bought from France are yet to see delivery.So acute is the situation that IAF earlier this year was looking to acquire 21 MiG-29 jets lying in a mothballed condition in Russia since the 1980s. And all this ‘jugaad’ is at a time when other forces are looking to fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. Understandably, the budget for weapons modernisation is tight. But funds can be freed up by pursuing greater integration within the forces and creating joint theatre commands. And to move along this tri-service architecture it is imperative that the post of chief of defence staff is inaugurated forthwith.'}]\n",

Having a razor thin majority in the assembly, the show of dissent will worry Yediyurappa despite success in persuading the central leadership to accommodate many of his loyalists. With a lion’s share of BJP seats coming from Lingayat strongholds and northern Karnataka, it was only natural for the community and the region to corner a major chunk of the berths.The cabinet expansion has left vacant 16 berths, perhaps to accommodate some more BJP MLAs and many of the 17 currently “disqualified” MLAs who have contested the former Speaker’s decision in Supreme Court. The hung verdict from last year’s assembly polls continues to haunt Karnataka, and Yediyurappa will have to keep making many compromises if these 16 berths become a bone of contention. Governance then becomes the casualty as had happened under the Congress-JD(S) government for 14 months.Yediyurappa has already started off on a wrong note, cutting a sorry figure chairing one-man cabinet meetings when the state was reeling under its deadliest flooding in recent years. Now with his cabinet in place he must attack the source of the flooding, which is reportedly the unfinished network of dams and irrigation canals along the Krishna basin in north Karnataka. Rs 52,000 crore of funds have been allocated for irrigation and flood control projects in the past four years but have achieved little – even in mitigating drought which has become a constant phenomenon in the state, including much of this year before the heavy rains from July.The capital Bengaluru, Karnataka’s major revenue spinner, is also in critical need of an infrastructure revamp with many residents beginning to tire of its crippling traffic jams and acute water crisis. Focus on such issues instead of precious time expended in politics of balancing caste, region and factions would help Yediyurappa efface uncharitable memories of his earlier stint as CM between 2008 and 2011 which was riddled with corruption charges and horse-trading allegations. Even the police probes into Congress-JD(S) era shenanigans betray an attempt at political diversion.

In fact, as much as 27% of the data had already been re-verified earlier. The re-verification demand now is coming from groups who feel that illegal migrants have made it to the NRC and genuine citizens have been left out.This is extremely likely given India’s poor documentation culture. Many of Assam’s residents who are being told to prove their citizenship simply don’t have documents. This doesn’t mean they are all migrants. Add to this the fact that the NRC exercise always had an ethnic dimension to it where Bengali was conflated with Bangladeshi. BJP muddied the waters further by proposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which provided a path to citizenship for Hindus from Bangladesh with December 31, 2014 as the cut-off date. This directly contradicted the Assam Accord which laid down March 24, 1971 as the cut-off for absorbing migrants.Given the north-east’s extremely diverse ethno-religious make-up, a veritable can of worms has been opened. Both the earlier Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and Centre’s recent nullification of Article 370 vis-a-vis Jammu & Kashmir have raised concerns in other north-east states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram which have their own ethnic, nativist issues.

Coercive measures such as putting them in detention camps will certainly attract charges of gross human rights violation.

The report is not yet in public domain but the broad thrust is to lower tax rates, simplify the architecture and use IT extensively. It is welcome and we hope that it will have a greater impact than the last effort. Direct tax legislation plays an important role in influencing investment decisions. Getting it right will have a positive impact on India’s economic prospects.For a while now, we have seen repeated attempts by governments to raise the effective rate of income and corporate taxes through special cesses and levies. For sure, there have been attempts to provide relief at the lower end of the spectrum for both personal and corporate taxes. But these have been offset by other decisions. A light touch regulation and moderate rates will have a beneficial impact on economic activity. Once economic momentum increases, it automatically translates into a higher quantum of revenue flowing into the exchequer. The new code should be driven by this approach.One way of increasing economic momentum is to provide stability to the policy regime and complement it with an unobtrusive enforcement mechanism. For quite some time, the tax department has been legally empowered to use databases of banks and mutual funds to ensure that taxpayers do not evade their legitimate dues. The new code is expected to build on it. IT is a powerful tool which can reduce evasion quite dramatically. The potency of this tool to work in an unobtrusive manner is evident in OECD countries. India needs to match those standards.Finally, a tax code has to be in sync with a country’s social and economic evolution. The reality for most people in India is that at a time when life spans are increasing, they have to manage a life of retirement without a pension. In an ideal world, a tax code should not provide any exemptions. The Indian reality is far from ideal. Therefore, it is heartening that the signs are that the proposed code is designed to accommodate this reality.'}]\n",

The sales dip has forced companies to cut production, lay off workers, run fewer shifts and even wind up showrooms, all leading to reported job losses of 3.5 lakh workers since April 2019. Given that auto industry accounts for a large share of India’s manufacturing output government must go slow on its electric vehicle promotion schemes at this juncture.It was only in April 2017 that two-wheelers had made a laborious transition to BS-IV norms after desperately trying to liquidate BS-III stock and within a short span of time they are now being forced to upgrade to BS-VI norms to meet the April 2020 deadline. Car manufacturers are also racing to meet the deadline even as liquidating current stock remains a headache. The considerable investment needed for these upgradations isn’t helped by government talk of banning IC engines. This has hurt both industry and customer sentiment.It is not that the auto industry is unaware of the slow but steady shift to EVs. All manufacturers have committed significant investment and resources to research and development of EVs because no one can afford to be left behind in the technology race. At the same time they are worried about consumer behaviour and vehicle buying patterns being disrupted by ride hailing apps.

On the other hand, the logic for nullification of Article 370 is that autonomy and special status for Kashmir keep separatist hopes alive. That’s something New Delhi wants to take off the table now, rhetorically amplified by the statement that it will now negotiate only on PoK.If this is a maximalist position, it’s a response to Pakistani maximalism that spurns any number of peace initiatives from successive Indian governments as it attempts to wrest J&K by any means possible. And if Islamabad has currently opened up a fusillade on all fronts against New Delhi, including on the LoC, Beijing has moved to provide it diplomatic cover by interceding on its behalf at the UN Security Council.However, the majority of participating UNSC members have concurred, in a closed door meeting, that the issue ought to be resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan. This has been New Delhi’s position throughout since the 1972 Simla Agreement. But China’s bid to influence international opinion in Pakistan’s favour is something that New Delhi must take note of. In particular, China’s talk of human rights violations in Kashmir has to leave one slack jawed, given its severely repressive rule in Tibet and internment of a million Uighurs in Xinjiang in ‘re-education’ camps. New Delhi should not now refrain from criticising Beijing on human rights issues, or using economic levers against China as China habitually does against other countries.It needs to be recognised that apart from principles India’s diplomatic victory over Kashmir was also made possible by its open society and growing economic heft that offers business opportunities. Thus, New Delhi needs to strengthen these assets further and not fall prey to protectionist headwinds and insular mindsets. Policies that undermine economic growth also undermine diplomatic heft. Next, Kashmir needs to be handled sensitively and apprehensions of Kashmiris must be mitigated.

It also lies at the heart of an attempt to ease the lives of both wealth creators and other citizens. But intent by itself will not end harassment. That requires reform in both tax policy and the incentive structure for enforcement officials.Tax harassment has its roots partly in the government’s insatiable need for revenue. Revenue targets are often fixed without taking a realistic view of economic momentum. If data emerges, as is the case this year, that targets are clearly out of sync with economic growth, it puts pressure on tax officials to find unusual ways to meet it. In this scenario, harassment and questionable practices are a foregone conclusion. Therefore, if government is sincere about its desire to end tax harassment, it needs to take the first step by setting a target which is realistic. Also, tax changes proposed in the budget need to be based on a more rigorous analysis of potential consequences.On the policy side, India has a chance to soon reform its direct tax regime. A new report on direct tax reforms is due. It should propose a regime which removes the complications of numerous exemptions. Simultaneously, there needs to be a reduction in tax rates.

Yet, estimates of 12 billion tonnes of poisonous, carcinogenic plastic waste litter by 2050 in landfills/ soil/ water bodies and entering animal, avian, marine and human food chains causing disease and premature deaths calls for isolating plastic’s most frivolous uses. Single-use plastics like grocery bags, milk and chips packets, shampoo and ketchup sachets – rampant and of too poor quality to recycle or reuse – fits this bill.Humanity cannot afford such luxuries anymore and must change course. Based on a 2015 CPCB study, it is estimated that India produces 25,490 tonnes of plastic waste daily. A city like Delhi generating 690 tonnes plastic waste daily recycles only 10% of it. CPCB also found 80% of plastics went into packaging; packaging accounts for 50% of global plastic waste. It is a pandemic and India can take cues from global attempts at bans, levies, incentives for industry to recycle and promotion of alternatives like cloth bags.A 2018 UNEP report offers a wealth of information for policy makers on regulation of single-use plastics. India’s own Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, bans plastic bags less than 50 microns in thickness but are dogged by weak enforcement and continuing popularity of plastic bags among retailers and consumers, cheap for the former and virtually free of cost for the latter. Imposing levies on plastic bags for consumers, successful in many developed countries, is tricky in India given how push cart vendors and mom-and-pop stores also qualify as retailers and are outside the tax net.The UNEP report lauds Rwanda for a successful ban and notes that Denmark and Portugal’s levies on suppliers forcing them to pass this on to retailers and consumers triggered a 50-75% drop in plastic bag sales. The Indian context also requires innovations like dry/ powdered shampoos in paper sachets and incentives even for ragpickers who do yeoman service in segregation of solid waste for precious little and at great personal health risk. India’s per capita generation of plastic waste might pale before the developed world but the absolute numbers are forbidding.

Instead, the government should double down on its existing program, ‘Mission Parivar Vikas’, which seeks to provide an enabling environment for people to make decisions in sync with national goals. It’s a matter of pride for India that fertility rates are declining fast on account of choices exercised by people. In addition to creating an enabling environment, the government needs to commission research on the regional patterns of fertility declines.

Pehlu’s sons are fighting charges of cow smuggling, a tack to solidify the perception that the victims were somehow responsible for their own lynching.

When the issue was taken to the Supreme Court it too worried about the lockdown’s implications for civil liberties, but also said the Centre needs time to normalise the sensitive situation in the state.Simply put, if large scale riots break out in the Valley following the nullification of Article 370, and murder and mayhem ensues, that too would violate civil liberties and the government would be blamed for it. Article 370 itself raises similar issues. Its nullification has been welcomed in many quarters of Jammu and Ladakh, who saw it as a tool to impose the rule of an uncaring Valley elite on their regions, as well as by Kashmiri Pandits who saw 370’s nullification as the first step towards their return to a homeland from which they had been expelled. But in large parts of the Valley, it’s liable to be seen as a forcible imposition that drowns Kashmir’s unique identity.Outside Kashmir too threats to civil liberties abound. For example, draconian colonial-era sedition laws seem to be invoked more frequently, and trivially, these days than even the colonial period. Alongside, the notion has taken hold that anything “hurting one’s sentiments” is a criminal offence deserving arrest and prosecution, precluding the freedom of expression that is democracy’s necessary precondition. Freedom thus remains work in progress, sometimes even regressing.\\xa0'}]\n",

On the heels of a yearlong slowdown in sales came the news that vehicle sales in the month were the worst on record in nearly 19 years. The bellwether industry recorded an 18.7% decline in sales in July. Passenger vehicle sales fell 31%, the ninth straight decline. For sure, the auto industry is not the only one adversely affected by weakening consumer demand. But it stands out as it has a significant impact in terms of jobs and sentiment.The auto industry generates about 35 million jobs, directly and indirectly, and accounts for about 49% of the manufacturing GDP. The sector has strong linkages with other segments of the manufacturing ecosystem and therefore, its problems will ripple out. The July numbers may have been jolting but the drawn-out decline has already had consequences. According to the automobile dealers association about two lakh jobs have been cut across dealerships in the last three months. The pile-up of inventory suggests the job loss in the industry is likely to be larger. As the industry has a large number of contract workers, the scale of job loss is not easy to gauge. But it’s bound to be significant.The government must, first of all, ensure an element of policy stability. There needs to be a dialogue between government and industry which should translate into a reasonable road map on regulatory evolution. Also, a fallacious argument is being made that fiscal concessions should not be sector specific. The essence of fiscal policy is to make choices to influence aggregate demand. Given the size of the auto industry and its workforce, as well as its upstream linkages, a fiscal boost is needed to stem the tide.'}]\n",

Monthly sales have shrunk in 12 of the last 13 months. The state of the auto industry encapsulates a larger economic problem. Simply put, the economy is fast losing momentum with many sectors reporting a slowdown in demand. There is really no evidence that demand is going to revive in a month or two, as proxy indicators for it such as percentage increase in salaries for the universe of listed companies suggest a challenging time ahead. To compound the problem, the global economy is also in the midst of a slowdown, making the possibility of a durable revival in exports unlikely.The corrective policy steps require a diagnosis of the current situation. Economists are split on whether the problem is structural or a cyclical one. RBI has veered towards the problem being cyclical. Setting aside the debate for a moment, the government should not take its eyes of an agenda which has to encompass deep rooted reforms in factors of production such as land and labour. Along with it, government now needs to consider specific steps to help earmarked sectors. The auto industry, for example, employs millions. Many of the contract employees are vulnerable as a year’s battering has led to scaling down of production. Government now needs to show urgency and respond to the situation by talking to stakeholders in the worst affected sectors.Read full Story: Auto sales in India sees sharpest fall 19 years in July; 15,000 workers lose jobs'}]\n",

After all, its supremo Pawan Kumar Chamling was India’s longest serving chief minister, ruling Sikkim with an iron hand and winning five successive terms between 1994 and 2019.The rebellion – which has enough numbers to sidestep the anti-defection law – underlines BJP’s strategy to welcome politicians without a Sangh Parivar background in states where the party’s organic growth is taking too much time. This strategy has yielded rich dividends in states like Assam, Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Odisha where BJP has gone on to form first-time governments or is posing strong challenges to incumbents. Interestingly, BJP’s new recruits have come from both national and regional parties.Its success vis-a-vis regional parties indicate a significant constituency for BJP’s brand of nationalism even in states which have a history of strong regional aspirations and sub-nationalist tendencies. It is also a fact that parties which appealed to regional or caste identities have disappointed many voters and are now weakening.

There are about 1.75 lakh officers and soldiers currently deployed in organisations ranging from Military Engineer Services and National Cadet Corps to Territorial Army and Sainik Schools. Reducing their manpower will save around Rs 1,600 crore in revenue expenditure. Such downsizing is desperately needed as the budget for weapons modernisation remains very tight. As much as 83% of the army’s annual budgetary outlay is devoted only to day-to-day running costs and salaries.Therefore, much more is needed in this direction to restructure the army and create a leaner, high-tech fighting force. Overall, the army needs to shed around 1.5 lakh personnel over the next six to seven years to save around Rs 7,000 crore annually. This is a huge task and needs to be broken up into smaller steps. It’s welcome that the first batch of reforms is slated to kick off any day, entailing the relocating of 229 officers to operational posts from the army’s headquarters in Delhi. In any case, the army is too top heavy, with a shortage of officers in fighting ranks of Lt-Colonels and below.A better teeth-to-tail ratio will only come about through greater streamlining and integration. This is also important because the nature of warfare itself has changed with greater emphasis on limited, high-tech wars. Therefore, we need a fighting force that is rapidly deployable and operationally versatile. Last year, government notified rules to enable joint theatre commands bringing together the three services. We should push ahead in this direction and set aside turf wars. There’s also an urgent need to create the post of chief of defence staff to move along tri-service integration.In this regard, we must take a leaf out of China’s book. As part of its military modernisation drive, China has already slashed its army strength by three lakh troops.

The next phase will see growth of fixed line broadband as the Internet of Things (IoT) makes its presence felt in more homes and businesses.This however does not minimise the importance of telecom spectrum policy. India’s mobile phone connections have grown about 25 times over the last 15 years despite government policies. The substandard quality of policy making is encapsulated by the confusion and controversy over the pricing of telecom spectrum. Over a decade, spectrum policy has moved from discretionary allotments at low prices which distorted the playing field to one of auctions which have become a revenue maximisation exercise for government. This transformation has resulted in a telecom industry burdened by crushing debt and a banking sector apprehensive about its loans to this industry.The fourth industrial revolution provides India unprecedented opportunities to overcome contemporary obstacles to economic growth. This will, by itself, lead to revenue growth for the government. Therefore, it’s important to ensure a sensible floor price for spectrum auctions as it will be the foundation for the roll out of 5G technology.

Although the visit was supposed to primarily focus on arrangements for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to India later this year, New Delhi’s decision to revoke special status for Jammu & Kashmir was bound to figure in Jaishankar’s parleys with his Chinese counterpart. Plus, Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also made a trip to Beijing a few days ago. He had sought Chinese support to take India’s recent move on J&K to the UN Security Council.In fact, Pakistan is currently engaging in widespread diplomatic efforts to drum up international support for its Kashmir position. India needs to quickly move to counter this propaganda offensive. All the more so because Western opinions on the legal, diplomatic, political and historical aspects of the Kashmir issue aren’t always well-informed, while China has a tendency of standing by Pakistan. For example, few are aware of the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits, or of blatant human rights violations in PoK where large-scale demographic changes have been engineered, while Islamabad itself has hived off Gilgit-Baltistan from Kashmir.It’s especially important that India mobilises its diplomatic resources and informs its foreign partners about realities on the ground, since Pakistan could launch terror strikes against India and the evidence is likely to be discovered. Should that happen, the two countries would be pushed to the brink of war. Thankfully though, most of the international players that Pakistan has reached out to so far have been neutral. While the US has said there is no change in its Kashmir position, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres has pointed to the 1972 Simla Agreement that states that all disputes between India and Pakistan will be resolved through bilateral negotiations.China has reacted sharply to India’s decision to convert Ladakh into a Union territory because Beijing sees itself as an interested party here. But Jaishankar has rightly pointed out that differences between the two sides must not become disputes. Just as India doesn’t comment on China’s internal matters, be it Xinjiang or Hong Kong, Beijing too should respect New Delhi’s internal matters. In fact, both sides should utilise this moment to resolve their long-pending boundary dispute so that bilateral relations can be taken to the next level. Also, Beijing should know that taking Pakistan’s side on Kashmir will not only alienate India, it will also encourage terrorism in the region which too will harm Chinese interests.'}]\n"

Linked to a spike in air pollution in neighbouring cities, especially Delhi NCR, stubble burning is being discouraged and even penalised but many farmers are reluctant to change course.They must be persuaded that subsidies funded by a Rs 1,151 crore central package for purchase of happy seeders that sow seeds without removing previous crop stubble and associated straw management systems are not just about mollifying cities. The study’s findings of greater moisture retention in soil, reduced water requirement, improved soil quality, and greater resilience to climate stress translate into better yields and lower input costs – music to the kisan’s ears. The problem is, a 2017 survey revealed that only 11% of farmers use happy seeders though 86% have seen it in action.

In that sense, Congress’s dilemma on Article 370 reflects the party’s leadership struggle at the moment. Should the party continue to look to the Gandhis for leadership or should it initiate a search outside the Congress first family?But every crisis also presents an opportunity. The Article 370 debate could be the inflection point for Congress where a significant number of party leaders choose to come out of the shadow of the Nehru-Gandhi legacy. This in turn could start a much-needed reform of Congress’s internal structures with partymen more attuned to public perceptions rising through the party ranks. Besides, BJP has shown that winning Hindi heartland states is crucial to coming to power at the Centre. If Congress is to revive its political fortunes, it can’t ignore this reality. A tough road lies ahead and the party needs fresh thinking from fresh leaders.'}]\n",

Her interventions on Twitter helped many cut through the maddening bureaucratic maze and diplomatic protocols. Her assistance to an interfaith couple harassed by a passport officer pitted her against today’s right wing trolls, but she refused to cede ground and acquitted herself with grace.These fighting qualities saw her becoming chief minister in a faction-ridden Delhi BJP government in 1998 and being felled by an untimely onion price rise, taking on Sonia Gandhi from Bellary in 1999 in an unequal fight, and again crossing swords with Sonia in 2004 when the latter appeared to be emerging as a PM candidate.

In this regard Mohandas Pai, former Infosys CFO, has publicly articulated what others have said in private. It’s not too farfetched to describe the prevailing environment as one of tax terrorism. Policies have become increasingly extractive in nature and are backed by coercive measures such as threats of arrests. In an already ailing economy this approach will make things worse.Taxation is part of the larger fiscal policy which aims to influence aggregate demand. In India, fiscal policy is designed in a make-believe world. Tax targets are often based on an unrealistic assessment of prevailing economic conditions. Revenue targets end up being overambitious. Alongside, successive budgets have granted more discretionary powers to tax officers. The outcome is an environment where the taxman is incentivised to be coercive. What businessmen are hesitantly saying today has been described in detail in CAG audits of the tax department. The case against the tax department has been made by a constitutional body.NDA should go back to what it once promised: minimum government, maximum governance. Giving this slogan concrete shape can come through a light touch regulatory environment which will promote faster economic and job growth. If that is complemented by moderate tax rates and a policy rid of exemptions, the Laffer Curve will kick in. The government can then raise greater revenue for its welfare commitments.

People in Jammu and Ladakh are likely to welcome the change of Jammu & Kashmir’s status with the Narendra Modi government’s nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution; the same cannot be said of Kashmir. Over the last week the Centre had massively boosted security presence in Kashmir, curtailed the annual Amarnath yatra and even put Kashmiri leaders under house arrest. Clearly, the Centre felt that the security situation could get out of hand with its big Kashmir move.And that threat remains as there could still be big protests in the Kashmir Valley as restrictions there are gradually removed. In fact, there has been a pattern of cyclical violence in Kashmir where large-scale upheavals take place after a period of radicalisation. We saw this in the case of militant Burhan Wani’s death in 2016 which sparked widespread violent protests across Kashmir. Those protests could recur, perhaps on a bigger scale. Supporters of Article 370 would point to its nullification as the reason. Opponents will claim it was going to happen anyway, given that Islamabad feels its time to push a Kashmir jihad is now, following its success in getting the US to wind down in Afghanistan without leaving a stable government in place.But either way, New Delhi will have to find a way of dealing with another round of radicalisation in the Valley. To counter this, the government should sensitively deal with protesters demonstrating against the nullification of special status. One way out could be to offer a path back to statehood for J&K. Union home minister Amit Shah alluded to this in Parliament when he said that J&K can regain its statehood once the situation there normalises.Facilitating development of Kashmir has been cited by government as one of the reasons for nullifying Article 370. Theoretically, now that outsiders can buy property, live and work in Kashmir, this can bring in greater business investment. While its tourism sector could be made world class tax benefits, loosening of regulations, and building of new infrastructure could see modern industries like IT relocate to the region. That’s the Kashmir dream. In real life, the security situation must be stabilised and the government must arrive at a modus vivendi with locals. That looks like being a long haul.'}]\n"

      "[{'score': 0.8992916, 'doc': 'In a momentous decision, government moved Parliament yesterday to abate Article 370 of the Constitution and supersede Article 35A, thereby effectively ceasing the special status for Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill to bifurcate the state and create two separate Union territories – Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without a legislature. This means that the Constitution of India shall now apply in full force across J&K and Ladakh, and the J&K legislature will henceforth not have any discretionary powers to decide who permanent residents of the territory are or provide them with special rights with respect to employment and acquisition of property.Abrogating Article 370 has been a long-held wish of BJP which sees the provision as a historical wrong. However, the complicated history of Kashmir and the sensitivity surrounding the matter had hitherto prevented such a move. But with the current BJP government projecting muscular nationalism and enjoying significant numerical strength in Parliament, cessation of Article 370 became more doable. Given that abrogating Article 370 was part of the BJP manifesto, on the basis of which it swept Lok Sabha polls, the government has the mandate to do this. That non-NDA parties like BSP, AAP, YSRCP, BJD and AIADMK too have come out in support of the government’s move shows which way the winds are blowing.Arguably, Article 370 had contributed to the problems in Kashmir. The state’s special powers of autonomy meant in practice arrogation of power by a tiny Valley elite, which led to a feeling of not being represented among the people of Jammu and Ladakh, as well as disaffection feeding into separatist sentiment in the Valley itself. And given that Kashmir came to be a troubled state with separatist sentiments being stoked by Pakistan with the help of cross-border terrorism, this may have been the worst of both worlds. Besides, Article 370 was meant to be a temporary provision. In that sense its cessation now is congruent with historical constitutional perspective.That said, there are some issues with the way in which Article 370 is being nullified and the state bifurcated. Even according to the constitutional provision to abate Article 370, consultation with the J&K state assembly is deemed necessary before a constitutional order to this effect is passed. The government, however, has chosen to use the fact that there is no J&K government at the moment and substituted the latter with the J&K governor. While this approach may or may not be legally valid, it certainly bypasses wider discussion on the matter that would have been democratically sound.Second, the logic behind converting the state into two Union territories is also not plain. True, there has been a demand for Union territory status in Ladakh for some time. But with the cessation of Article 370, the special powers accruing to the J&K assembly in Srinagar would also extinguish. Thus, it is debatable if bifurcation of the state and creation of the Union territory of Ladakh was necessary after that.In fact, this would be the first time in the history of India that a state was being converted into Union territories – the trend has been the other way around. Hence, given the magnitude of the decision, more all-round discussion would have been prudent. But perhaps government’s decision to push ahead with its Article 370 move was linked to external factors. With the US looking to wind down its military engagement in Afghanistan and turning to Pakistan to facilitate a peace deal with Afghan Taliban, Islamabad has been upping the ante on Kashmir.New Delhi perhaps felt that Islamabad was gaining too much leverage in the emerging regional scenario and had to do something to counter this. Whatever the compulsions, even if Article 370 is abrogated New Delhi will have to – sooner rather than later – grant full statehood rights to Jammu & Kashmir and perhaps Ladakh too, for the sake of democratic governance as well as the federal principles in which India is grounded.'}]\n",

While both incidents are being investigated, the first one is being treated as a domestic terror attack motivated by racial hatred. In fact, the police cited a manifesto attributed to the El Paso shooter in which he lashed out at foreign tech workers and ranted about a Hispanic invasion.Mass shootings in the US aren’t new but it may be that President Donald Trump’s vocal position against immigrants, and corresponding soft-pedalling of white supremacists, is encouraging gun attacks. Critics say, add to this the current dispensation’s open support for the gun lobby and marginalisation of gun control, and we are basically looking at a recipe for mass shootings in the US.In 2016, the American people voted for Trump because of the poor jobs situation and disenchantment with the elite in that society. But Trump brings with him a far-right baggage that he politically can’t discard. Hence the toughening of immigration policies and leeway given to the gun lobby. Only if the American people decide that gun control is important and vote accordingly can things potentially change vis-à-vis gun violence in America. Meanwhile, with just a year to go for the US presidential polls, it looks like racism in the US may be increasing.

Valid questions are being raised about whether the security advisory issued by the J&K government, asking tourists and pilgrims to leave the Valley immediately, was really necessary.Nevertheless, there is a genuine sense within the security establishment that the unprecedented precautions are called for as a major Pakistan-backed terror attack is impending. Seven Pakistani infiltrators have been shot in a bid to enter the Valley. Terrorists from groups like JeM and Hizbul have also been intercepted in separate encounters, and arms recovered from them include devices with Pakistani markings and a US M-24 sniper rifle, suggesting a Pakistani hand. There is heavy firing from across the LoC, to which Indian forces are retaliating.The Amarnath yatra has been attacked by terrorists several times before. If another such attack happens in the present context, after Balakot, and evidence is found of a Pakistani hand, it would amount to a serious provocation and lead to a warlike situation. However, President Donald Trump’s offers to “mediate” on Kashmir may have put the Pakistani establishment in an adventurist mood. It could calculate that any international blowback to terror operations in Kashmir can be countered by threatening to withhold cooperation from US troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. In view of this fraught situation, a case can perhaps be made for extreme security precautions.However, the pulling out of outsiders together with a massive mobilisation of security forces is creating uncertainty and fear in the state. Understandably, it is making people speculate that something big is underway in J&K, and that the Centre is planning to abrogate Article 35A as well as Article 370, which give the state special powers of autonomy.

Speed cameras, CCTVs, speed guns, wearable cameras, etc can to an extent replace traffic police deployment on roads. Fortunately, the new law recognises these imperatives and tasks Centre with making rules for using these technologies and state governments with ensuring that these monitoring devices are installed on highways and other roads. Ultimately, police must actually send out challans and initiate prosecution for violations caught on camera for the move to succeed.The legislation factors in other ground realities too. It envisions a central scheme for cashless treatment to accident victims during the “golden hour” when emergency medical attention can save lives and mitigate debilitating injuries. For private hospitals that shy away from admitting accident victims fearing the expenditure this will serve as an incentive. Its recognition of ‘Good Samaritans’ and the harassment they face from police despite bringing hit-and-run victims to hospitals will also have a salutary effect. No less laudable is the provision that deems the parent or owner of the vehicle guilty for offences by juveniles.Authorities, contractors and consultants will face fines up to Rs 1 lakh for poor design, construction and maintenance of roads.

While most of the features of the bill are welcome, some aspects have the potential to be misused by the traffic police.Often, traffic police are reported to harass drivers and vehicle owners for inadvertent and trivial mistakes. There have been instances when traffic police penalize violators without registering their offences. In many cities, traffic police remains not just inactive but complicit in violations. In some drunk-driving cases, especially in small towns and cities without CCTV cameras on roads, traffic police officials allegedly accept bribes and let the violators go.

There remain many unanswered questions about his tragic demise. A letter attributed to him, alluding to what triggered his mental turmoil, points to a larger problem confronting the economy. India is a particularly challenging place to actualise an entrepreneur’s dream. Despite the best intentions of governments, firms – be they start-ups or long standing ones – have to spend an inordinate amount of time and resources in managing the regulatory environment. Unless this changes, a $5 trillion economy remains a long way away.Between the professed aims of policy makers and what actually materialises on the ground is a vast gap. This gap results in economic underperformance. To illustrate, GST was meant to make compliance with indirect tax easier in addition to creating a common market. However, that is not the case. This week CAG tabled in Parliament its first ever audit of GST’s compliance system. Its conclusion was dismal. “On the whole, the envisaged GST compliance system is non-functional,” the report said. A dysfunctional compliance system creates a chain of problems.One problem is the mammoth amount of tax litigation. In 2017-18, Rs 7.77 trillion of tax demands were locked in legal disputes. To put this in context, it represented 41% of the year’s actual collection of taxes. This warped approach, which encompasses all arms of the state, undermines every attempt at reform. Look no further than the bankruptcy code. It was meant to provide an exit route for struggling businesses and reallocate capital to more promising ventures. The actual experience of stakeholders has often been disappointing. Siddhartha’s untimely demise should catalyse a look at fundamental problems which shackle India’s economy and render it uncompetitive.'}]\n"

By prescribing three years imprisonment for Muslim men who pronounce the talaq-e-biddat, the law sticks out with rough edges for treating divorce as a criminal offence.From a system which gave archaic personal laws a long rope for decades to now criminalising practices like triple talaq that it fostered, India is veritably swinging between extremes. The old order had to change, but it is unfortunate that the new law failed to strike a balance. Personal laws gave religious leaders disproportionate influence and denied many people, especially women, the benefits of living in a free society and under meaningful protection of the state. By overriding personal laws, government is indeed doing Muslim women a world of good but in failing to treat triple talaq as a civil offence, as in any other messy divorce case, it may conceivably end up doing more harm than good to the woman.A legal challenge in Supreme Court is certain to raise issues like proportionality: whether the severity of punishment befits the seriousness of the crime and whether there are less onerous ways of achieving the legislation’s goals. In a sense the social and political cost of not having a Uniform Civil Code, which would have been in tune with the secular ethos of the country, is showing. From Congress “appeasement” of minorities – or to be more precise clerics within minority communities in the hope they would deliver a “vote bank” – the pendulum has now swung to the other extreme where, under a Hindutva-oriented government, the law appears to have a punitive edge for Muslim men.In a contrary scenario, a UCC would have united the country in true fashion where citizens irrespective of religion would follow the same laws for marriage, divorce, succession, etc. This government has a manifesto that promises UCC and a mandate that can make it happen.

India is now home to almost 75% of the global tiger population. In fact, the latest tiger census shows that India has achieved the goal of doubling tiger population from the 2006 baseline of 1,411 tigers. A lot of resources were poured into the latest survey with 3,81,400 sq km of forests covered and 26,838 camera trap locations set up at 141 sites. As many as 2,461 individual tigers – 83% of the total – have actually been photographed by trap cameras.The credit for this spurt in tiger numbers goes to increased vigilance and conservation efforts. From 28 in 2006, the number of tiger reserves in the country went up to 50 in 2018. This increased protection to tiger areas has seen tiger numbers multiply in core forest areas, leading to a spillover into outer areas. This also indicates measures to control poaching are actually working with organised poaching reportedly declining dramatically.Tigers are apex predators and therefore a healthy growth in their numbers is indicative of healthy ecosystems that can support a large prey base. Thus, the latest tiger survey does give environmentalists some reason to cheer. However, issues with the methodology of tiger counting remain. For example, in 2014 tigers aged 1.5 years or older were counted. The current report has the cut-off age as 1 year. The reason for this change remains unexplained. Previously, some experts had even pointed out a mismatch between growing tiger numbers and shrinking tiger habitats. Plus, there seems to be state-wide variation in tiger numbers. While Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttarakhand have the top three tiger populations, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have seen the biggest decreases – 37.8% and 26.9% declines respectively from 2006.Add to this the fact that cases of man-animal conflict are increasing across the country. To address this, wildlife tourism needs to be boosted. This will not only prevent killing of animals, but also create stakeholders in protecting wildlife reserves by providing employment opportunities to locals.

The very next day the woman lost her father after he was allegedly assaulted by the MLAs’ aides.

But the failure to commence trial despite over 12 months elapsing has proven costly for the survivor. The Criminal Procedure Code directs the completion of trial in rape cases within two months.Now with the “accident” case also transferred to it, CBI must investigate the possibility that it was orchestrated to destroy evidence, as the survivor was the main witness. On July 12, she had written to Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi alleging coercion by the MLA’s aides to sabotage the case. The blackened licence plates of the truck that rammed into her may not be a coincidence either. Last December Supreme Court approved Centre’s witness protection scheme which envisioned conducting of threat analysis for key witnesses, constant police protection, lodging them in safe houses, giving them new identities if necessary, and monitoring their phones.

Official data on immigration from Bangladesh is consistent with anecdotal evidence. An argument which has gained currency is that the economic motive for Bangladeshis to cross the border into India began to decline with an improvement in economic conditions at home. Data, from eight years ago, lends credence to it. This is important given that the fear of being swamped by illegal immigration is triggering poor policy decisions.If anything, Bangladesh has economically performed better since Census 2011. It has grown at over 7% over the last few years. IMF estimates that it’s likely to grow faster than India in 2019-20, at over 7.5%. Consequently, it’s reasonable to assume that underlying causes for illegal immigration from Bangladesh are weakening. However, Indian politics remains hostage to demons of the past. That only vitiates the atmosphere within India and extracts a price from Indians. To illustrate, the Centre recently asked the Supreme Court to extend the deadline to finalise Assam’s NRC because it feared errors of both inclusion and exclusion.The apex court did extend the deadline but did not accept the Centre’s plea for reverification. It could mean that genuine citizens now face the prospect of disenfranchisement. For sure, government must not tolerate illegal immigration.

In that sense he will feel vindicated that BJP – being the single largest party within touching distance of the halfway mark in the house – has regained the reins of power. Yet he will have to be mindful that the result was achieved by the house strength coming down from 225 to 208 after the defection of 17 Congress and JD(S) rebels, making BJP’s present majority in the house a notional one at best.However, the messy disqualification of the 17 rebels by Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar, who also stepped down from his post on Monday, may give Yediyurappa a longer rope. The rebels, whose political careers are now in jeopardy, have sufficient ground to contest Kumar’s ruling disqualifying them for the remainder of the assembly’s tenure. This can lead to prolonged litigation and Yediyurappa may not mind the resulting delay in holding bypolls. Recall that in a similar precedent in Tamil Nadu, the Speaker disqualified 18 AIADMK rebels in September 2017 but the bypolls were held nearly 19 months later in April 2019.A long delay could suit Yediyurappa twofold: He won’t have to worry about earmarking a lion’s share of Cabinet berths for the defectors, which in turn would have caused heartburn among senior BJP MLAs. Second, he only needs to retain the present majority to keep his government afloat. However, Congress, unlike the AIADMK faction led by TTV Dhinakaran, could press their top legal eagles into action demanding quick settlement of the legal wrangling and for speedy conduct of the bypolls.Yediyurappa can take heart that the BJP central leadership has gone along with his plans to oust HD Kumaraswamy and stake claim to form a new government.

So much so that last week the Modi government amended the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission to seek ways to fund defence budgets. Defence preparedness is based partially on a faster growing economy and better management of government finances.Finally, India’s strategic restraint by not expanding the conflict into Pakistan catalysed a shift in Indo-US ties.

He further blamed previous Pakistani governments for not being in control of the situation and said they did not tell the US about the truth on the ground. It is to Khan’s credit that he has accepted that Pakistan shelters terrorists, including those that have carried out militancy in Kashmir. This contradicts Pakistan’s traditional position that it only provides moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri militants. India has always maintained that terrorism in Kashmir is sustained from across the line of control.What prompted such candour on Khan’s part? He may be trying to convince the US that his administration recognises the problem of terror and is willing to deal with it. Note that Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed was taken into protective custody in the run-up to Khan’s US visit. He has also admitted that the armed militias that Pakistan harbours are hurting it. But the proof of the pudding needs to be in the eating. We still have to see if Khan is serious about taking concrete action against terror.After all, Khan is known in Pakistani political circles as ‘Taliban Khan’ for his past vocal support of Taliban and other extremists. Besides, the real power centre in Pakistan, the military-ISI complex, has long nurtured a strategy of asymmetric warfare against India through terror proxies. Thus, it remains to be seen if Khan and Rawalpindi GHQ are truly in sync on tackling terror or they have come up with a new variant of their ‘good terror, bad terror’ policy. Even as Khan should be given an opportunity to show that he can walk his talk, New Delhi must remain cautious.'}]\n",

If Rajya Sabha too follows suit, it will allow government to designate an individual as a terrorist without much due process. Hitherto only terror organisations were proscribed under UAPA even as it prescribes punishments for persons who conduct terrorist acts, organise recruitment and financing, etc. But the new provision allowing government to designate “terrorist individuals” is virtually tantamount to presuming guilt even before the person has been found guilty by a court. This would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.Such sweeping executive powers in the hands of government will have a chilling effect on civil liberties and free speech. The loose term – urban Maoist – used by ruling party leaders to tar activists with leftwing leanings is an example of the wide net that can be cast in search of “terrorist individuals”. Merely harbouring an opinion or an ideology could haul political dissidents or even opposition leaders into the dragnet, when article 19 of the Indian Constitution declares freedom of expression to be a fundamental right. Trinamool Congress parliamentarian Mahua Moitra has pointed to a powerful propaganda machinery that labels critics of the government as “anti-nationals”. How much of a leap is it from designating someone as “anti-national” to “terrorist”?Government’s biggest failing has been in allaying fears that the amendments intend to target ideologies on the pretext of “zero tolerance policy” towards terror. Its claim that the amendments will lead to speedy investigation/prosecution mustn’t come at the cost of due process. UAPA is already a very stringent law placing the burden of proof in some offences on the accused, allowing up to 180 days custody without filing chargesheets and incarceration during trial. Rather than more legislation, the onus must thus be on strengthening investigation capabilities which NIA appears to have achieved over the past decade.Yet even NIA’s autonomy came under question following Malegaon terror blasts ex-prosecutor Rohini Salian’s revelations that an NIA officer asked her to “go soft”. This was followed by the ruling party sending up terror suspect Sadhvi Pragya Thakur to Parliament, controverting the government claim of “zero tolerance of terror” and reinforcing the suspicion that certain ideologies, rather than terrorist acts, are sought to be targeted by the latest UAPA amendments. Government mustn’t arm itself with arbitrary and authoritarian powers which lend themselves to misuse, simply because it has a brute majority in Parliament.'}]\n",

At one level, the letter which deals lynching and use of religious slogans in political campaigns. It’s naturally triggered a sharp debate on partisan lines. However, the larger issues raised by the letter are relevant and have also evoked attempts by all political parties to find answers. Lynching is a particularly problematic issue as it indicates a complete breakdown of law and order.In the last few years, there has been a spate of lynching across India on account of religious prejudice, caste hatred and superstition. Consequently, Supreme Court last year suggested a special law to deal with it and the Modi government constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the issue. Eventually, Manipur, a BJP-administered state, became the first one to enact an explicit law to deal with lynching. Lynching therefore is a national problem and not a partisan issue.Separately, the increasing use of traditional religious slogans for political ends, even within Parliament, holds the danger of weakening national unity. In the political arena, one mode of campaigning always leads to an attempt to counter it. In the current Lok Sabha, during the swearing in of MPs, there was the dangerous recourse to religious slogans, countered by cries that extol sub-nationalism. This is a dangerous trend. Therefore Modi, as India’s most popular politician, should use his standing to steer the polity away from the obvious dangers of divisive trends.Read full story: ‘Jai Shree Ram has become a war-cry’: Celebs write to PM Modi over incidents of lynching'}]\n",

The leadership race was triggered after outgoing British premier Theresa May decided to step down as Conservative leader in June. This was after she failed to sell her Brexit withdrawal agreement to the British Parliament. But her replacement Johnson pitches an even harder line on Brexit and has said that he will leave the European Union with or without a deal come the October 31 deadline.However, a no-deal Brexit will be disastrous for the UK, causing much disruptions to trade, businesses and people. Johnson ideally wants to rewrite the Brexit deal. But Brussels is in no mood to relent. Besides, the British Parliament while rejecting May’s soft Brexit deal – which envisaged a combined customs territory and a 21-month transition period with EU – has also voted against a no-deal Brexit. Therefore, if Johnson tries to push through his ‘do-or-die’ approach to Brexit, it could trigger another leadership crisis within the Conservative Party.That said, Johnson does bring a new energy to the British prime ministership that had started to look jaded under May. He has promised a new ‘can do’ spirit, pledged to unite his country and present a radically new Cabinet that will include members from ethnic minority backgrounds. Two MPs with Indian background – Priti Patel and Alok Sharma – are likely to get Cabinet berths. In fact, Johnson’s connection with India runs deep – his estranged wife Marina Wheeler has Indian ancestry – and this could see India-UK relations acquire a special touch. But before that Johnson has to provide clarity on Brexit to ensure a stable administration in London. And that won’t be easy given the diverse and complex positions of British legislators.'}]\n"

With both parties viewing the state’s Old Mysuru region as their bastion, this was an incompatible and uneasy partnership from the start.A number of senior Congress leaders who enjoyed plum ministerial berths in the previous Siddaramaiah government had to be left out of the Cabinet. Siddaramaiah himself could not make peace with his sudden loss of pre-eminence in Congress and has been blamed for fanning dissidence against the government. Yet Congress’s national compulsions took precedence over the bubbling local disenchantment. Ultimately, the 2019 general election results helped catalyse the logical end. Congress-JD(S) calculations of consolidating the anti-BJP vote were swept away by another gigantic Modi wave producing BJP’s best ever performance in Karnataka.Only one Congress and JD(S) candidate each could withstand the BJP juggernaut that won 25 of the state’s 28 seats with a phenomenal 51.4% vote share. But in the assembly BJP will be saddled with the hung verdict from 2018. Arguably, the party may be better off seeking a fresh mandate but the pro-incumbency vote for Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not repeat in a state-level election. Governing with a wafer-thin majority will be a challenge. Assembly bypolls – if the rebel MLAs are disqualified or their resignations are accepted – will become crucial.

Consequently, a practical solution has been prescribed: the projects will be completed by public sector builder NBCC.Unlike other industries, potential homebuyers often fund real estate development through advance payments.

Such “mediation” has long been sought by Pakistan, and arguably goes back to the genesis of the Kashmir issue itself as both the Kashmir insurgents and their backers in the Pakistani military are aware that they cannot oust India from Kashmir on their own. They hoped, however, that diplomacy followed by Western mediation will do the trick in this regard.It is another matter, of course, that no Western interest is served by a Kashmir taken over by Islamist forces, or one that’s turned into another version of Afghanistan. Over the years, even the US came to see things India’s way and acknowledged Pakistan’s sponsorship of cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. Indeed the US State Department’s South central Asia bureau has finessed the Trump statement by stating that while Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, the US stands by to assist if needed.What’s likely discernible here is Trump’s familiar blow-hot-blow-cold, ‘art of the deal’ strategy – which we had earlier seen applied (unsuccessfully) to North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un. Trump now needs Pakistani cooperation on Afghanistan as he prepares to pull US troops out, and to that end he lined up some carrots, including a reference to what he knows to be the Pakistani elite’s prime obsession – Kashmir. However, this gambit isn’t going to work. One, New Delhi won’t bite – it took no time to reiterate its “consistent” position on Kashmir being a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan. Two, Pakistan continues to see Afghanistan as strategic depth against India. It is likely to work to destabilise the Afghan government, as soon as the US withdraws.This, indeed, is the greatest danger currently: Afghanistan could see a Vietnam-like implosion following US withdrawal.

This was a week after the first attempted launch had to be aborted due to a technical glitch just an hour before lift-off. The second time, however, the powerful GSLV-MkIII-M1 rocket lifted off smoothly and placed the 3,850kg spacecraft into the Earth orbit. It will now take a series of complex manoeuvres for the spacecraft to be inserted into the Moon orbit following which the lander – christened Vikram – will detach from the orbiter and attempt a soft landing on the lunar surface.Should that be successful, a rover named Pragyaan is supposed to roll out of the lander and conduct experiments on the Moon’s surface. At that point, India would be catapulted into an elite club presently comprising just the US, Russia and China. Taken together, there’s no denying that Chandrayaan-2 is a far more complex mission than our first lunar project Chandrayaan-1. The stated objectives of Chandrayaan-2 are to explore the South Pole of the Moon, find more evidence of lunar water, uncover clues about the Moon’s evolution and work in the direction of converting the Moon into a test bed for deeper forays into space.Thus, Chandrayaan-2 is expected to enhance our space capabilities manifold. In fact, it’s an important step before India attempts to launch a manned space mission in 2022. Besides, space today is much more within our reach than ever before.

Salaries and allowances and other terms and conditions of service of central (and state chief) information commissioners, now at par with election commissioners, will instead be “such as may be prescribed by the central government”.In short, a move to undermine the status of the central and state information commissions – and turn them into “caged parrots” as the Supreme Court chose to describe the CBI – is afoot. Replacing a fixed statutory term that offers security of tenure with one where information commissioners (ICs) serve at the pleasure of government and on terms set by it impinges on institutional autonomy. The Act’s provisions offering parity with election commissioners had bestowed tremendous prestige upon ICs. It was a signifier of autonomy and to not be chary when issuing orders to all-powerful government officers unwilling to share information with citizens.There is no cogent reason to reverse this spirit of the RTI Act or grudge the quasi-parity with constitutional authorities like EC. Union minister Jitender Singh told Parliament that the information commission was only a statutory body but “clumsy” and “hasty” passage of the Act had “given the IC the status of a Supreme Court judge and at the same time left the provision of appeal to the High Court”. Without a trace of irony he also claimed the amendment bill was intended to streamline and strengthen the RTI Act.Diluting such a popular law will hurt NDA’s credibility and can dent the huge mandate received in May. Weakening RTI Act plays into bureaucracy’s hands. After all, citizens had used RTI to combat red tape. To actually strengthen RTI Act, promptly filling IC vacancies and more proactive mandatory disclosures of information will help.

It was also under Dikshit that Delhi made the switch to cleaner CNG fuel for public transport and moved to privatised electricity distribution. But perhaps her biggest achievement was in getting the residents of Delhi involved in the city’s development through the Bhagidari movement steered by residents’ welfare associations. This gave residents a sense of investment in the city.Politically, Dikshit handled relations with the Centre with much sophistication. That is in stark contrast to troubled Delhi-Centre relations today with AAP and BJP perpetually locking horns. However, even as she came to embody the spirit of Delhi, Dikshit’s downfall was sharp following the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

In 1960s, in the backdrop of two wars, food shortages, economic hardship and a power struggle within Congress, nationalisation found political support. It aimed to push banking into all segments, particularly agriculture. Nationalisation did have benefits. Gross saving as a proportion of GDP increased from 12% in 1968-69 to 34.65% by 2011-12. This domestic saving financed most of the concurrent increase in investment. However, political interests influenced operations. Till 1990, intermediation by public sector banks (PSBs) was biased in favour of government and new private banks were not allowed to come in.Early 1990s witnessed the entry of new private banks. But PSBs as a group still dominate. The bad loan crisis is largely that of PSBs. Political influence has undermined their soundness and extracted a cost in the form of repeated re-capitalisation, borne by taxpayers. Today, there’s no economic case for continued nationalisation.

The reasons cited assume significance when juxtaposed with the BJP demand to start an NRC in other states such as Bengal. After years of effort, monitored by SC, Assam’s BJP government says the list has errors of exclusion and inclusion. Moreover, the process has been vitiated by corruption.Illegal immigration into Assam is a long-standing problem and has catalysed violent agitations. Indeed it is the duty of government to prevent illegal immigration. But what emerged eventually as a solution was simplistic, reminiscent of UK’s disastrous Brexit referendum. In 2005, the Assam government decided to update NRC. The process turned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare. Most people have to produce documentation which links them to a legacy database that ends with electoral rolls up to March 24, 1971. In effect, the process starts with the presumption of guilt and the attendant turmoil is because many applicants are unable to provide satisfactory linkage documents.Millions of poor Indians still do not have adequate identity documents. That is why UIDAI allows for an introducer-based enrolment for Aadhaar in the absence of documents. To this pre-existing problem of scanty documentation, the NRC process has vested enormous power in petty bureaucracy and quasi-judicial bodies called Foreigner Tribunals. Corruption and abuse of power are inevitable. It should come as no surprise that Assam government believes the list is flawed and original inhabitants are being disenfranchised. It is also a clear admission that the whole exercise has been a mess, causing distress to lakhs of people.Moreover, the fate of those who won’t make it to the final NRC remains uncertain. So far, 40 lakh people did not make it to the draft NRC released last year. Last month, another one lakh people were excluded. Union home minister Amit Shah has said that illegal migrants living on every inch of Indian soil will be identified and deported. But deported where? Bangladesh has refused to acknowledge any large-scale migration to India since 1971. And keeping such large numbers in camps would certainly constitute violation of human rights, even if one ignores the expense and waste involved. Any talk of extending this quagmire beyond Assam should be scotched forthwith.'}]\n"

This led to enormous misallocation of resources and lost opportunities as zombie firms took up scarce resources. IBC is the best possible solution. On Wednesday, the Cabinet approved eight amendments to IBC aiming to safeguard the Code’s underlying spirit.A key aim of the Code is to induce behavioural change, particularly among promoters. Continued ownership following default of debt obligations is no longer guaranteed. One consequence of this aim is a spate of litigations. Insolvency likely has the single largest body of case laws. Some judicial interpretations seem to create doubt rather than clarify. In others, interpretation appears to run counter to the law’s aim. The resolution process of Essar Steel, where secured creditors have claims of Rs 45,559 crore, has dragged on way past the 270-day deadline as stakeholders mount legal challenges. The latest ruling in this case has created uncertainty for secured creditors.The aim of the eight amendments is to rectify these challenges by filling gaps in the corporate insolvency resolution framework.

But the proceedings of the Pakistani trial were opaque and no concrete evidence was provided by Islamabad to establish the charges against Jadhav.

But drawing any equivalence between the Pakistani terrorist who directly killed scores of Indian citizens during the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai and Jadhav is ridiculous. Moreover, Pakistan has resorted to extremely dubious procedures to sentence him. As Pakistan shelters terrorists on its own soil, it simultaneously employs a variety of tactics to ward off growing international pressure. The Pakistani military court’s sentencing of Jadhav was a part of this design to show that Islamabad too is a victim of terrorism.But the ICJ has called Pakistan’s bluff. It has charged Pakistan with violating the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. To rectify this, Pakistan must grant consular access to Jadhav immediately. Plus, it is also clear that a review of Jadhav’s sentence cannot be trusted to a Pakistani military court whose procedures do not meet the test of justice.

However, SC also ruled that the rebels could not be compelled to participate in the ongoing assembly session. In effect, the scales just tipped against Congress-JD(S), which was pinning their hopes on a whip mandating that the rebels participate in the trust motion and ensuring at least some of them vote for the government.Karnataka Congress chief Dinesh Gundu Rao has complained that the verdict “encroaches upon the rights of the legislature”, defangs the power to issue whips and undermines the anti-defection law. If the 15 rebels don’t vote, Congress-JD(S) will be reduced to a minority. Even if the Speaker chooses to disqualify the rebels for anti-party activity in the event of the government falling, it will not impede BJP’s claims to form a new government. At best, disqualification will prevent the rebels from immediately joining a newly sworn-in BJP ministry and force them to bide their time till they win re-election in bypolls. Congress-JD(S) has proceeded on the premise that the rebels prefer resignation and want to avert disqualification because they have been promised ministerial berths by BJP.But Congress-JD(S) attempts to mollify them by offering ministerial portfolios haven’t helped. The rebel response indicates the alliance is tottering. Even the daunting prospect of bypolls and the uncertainty of how the electorate will respond to turncoats haven’t deterred them.

Its total fertility rate – the number of children likely to be born to a woman – was 2.2 in 2017 which is close to the replacement level TFR of 2.1 – indicating that population will stabilise in the near future. Alongside, the younger demographic will slowly decline as a proportion of the total population, and the working age populace will peak around 2041.The low TFRs in the 1.6-1.7 range in Maharashtra, Bengal, Punjab and southern states, even as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag behind with a 3.0-3.2 TFR, will produce equally significant demographic shifts. As the relatively developed south ages, it could induce mass migration from Hindi speaking states – provided the applecart is not upset needlessly by latent sub-nationalist tendencies or ham-handed efforts to promote Hindi. Nevertheless, the pan-India rise in elderly population will require greater investment in healthcare, old age homes and social security schemes.Having received sufficient advance warning of these shifts, India must prepare for an orderly transition. Unfortunately, falling TFRs are just one side of the demographic evolution. While these indicate that women are gaining greater agency in planning childbirth, sex ratio at birth (SRB) – number of female babies born for every 1,000 male babies – has fallen to a record low of 896 in 2015-17, translating to a devastating 11.7 million missing girl children. Preference for male children appears to be combining with the pressure to have small families due to rising household expenditure to create a deadly cocktail for the girl child.This finds correlation in 2017-18 Economic Survey which notes that India’s sex ratio of last child (SRLC) in the case of first-born children is 1.82:1, heavily skewed in favour of boys compared with the ideal sex ratio of 1.05:1. Even top dog Kerala saw its SRB of 974 in 2012-14 plummet to 948 in 2015-17. Evidently, government has its work cut out in streamlining the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme.

Delhi also opened two peripheral expressways on its eastern and western flanks to divert traffic, especially heavy vehicles, that transited through the capital. It also shut down a polluting thermal power station despite its criticality for the city’s energy security.A common pattern across cities with higher PM10 levels like Delhi, Raipur and Vijayawada which made localised plans to tackle air pollution were high vehicular density, burning of crop residue in neighbouring districts, solid waste disposal, and construction activity. A carrot and stick approach is needed to move farmers away from burning crop stubble. Cities like Mumbai and Kolkata that are seeing an uptick in pollution must focus on upgrading urban infrastructure to ease traffic snarls and modernise decrepit public transport.

Beijing successfully conducted its first manned space mission in 2003 – something India is planning to do only by 2022 – and earlier this year became the first country to land a spacecraft on the dark side of the Moon.It is reasonable to surmise that China’s space prowess is aided by its overall scientific development on earth.

This led to another first, a super over in a World Cup final. Even that wasn’t enough to have a decisive winner as both teams ended up with 15 runs in six balls. But it was England who were crowned champions on account of the number of boundaries they hit — 26 to New Zealand’s 17.While the method of deciding the winner by the number of boundaries scored might be controversial — for example, one can argue that wickets taken should be valued more than sixes or fours — but that was the rule in this tournament. Besides, this was a decision that was made after even the super over option was exhausted. So, it was indeed an unusual way for England to win but much better than deciding the winner by, let’s say, a coin toss.The game itself was intense and had ebbs and peaks throughout. New Zealand did well to put a competitive total on the board given a tricky pitch. England, meanwhile, had a boisterous start in the second innings, but the Kiwis came back and kept chipping away at the English wickets. It was finally the 110-run partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler that steadied the English ship and set the stage for a dramatic finish.

This goes against the notion propagated by the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) that the Chinese are one people with common Asian values.The Asian values concept is meant to mark out a contrast with what are seen as ‘Western’ values with restricted application. The theory goes that Asian civilisations prize order, social cohesion and strong but benevolent governments over democracy. Thus, Asian nations ought to singularly focus on growth and power instead of democratic freedoms. Democracy, in this view, is colonial baggage. It’s a seductive concept, including in India, for those with authoritarian proclivities. But the biggest flaw in the theory is that it assumes Asian civilisations to be a monolith. If there are divergences even within Chinese societies, assuming uniformity among Asian civilisations encompassing multiple nations, cultures and ethnicities is preposterous.Further contradicting the CPC’s concept is Taiwan – a vibrant multiparty democracy of 23 million people. In fact, in recent years the pro-Taiwan independence plank has strengthened, rejecting major economic pacts with mainland China. A recent Academia Sinica survey found that more Taiwanese today value sovereignty over economic gains in negotiations with China. Moreover a recent poll carried out in Singapore, also majority ethnic Chinese, showed that three out of four Singaporeans support the Hong Kong protesters.

Collective effort should be directed towards adapting to this change.The change has been showing up in interconnected areas. First, research shows that there is an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall in India in the general backdrop of a dry epoch. Second, the past five years have been the warmest in modern record. Third, a consequence of these shifts is that sea levels are rising. Government recently informed Parliament that the sea level has been rising at the annual rate of 5.16 mm in Diamond Harbour, Bengal, a level noticeably higher than the global average.It can no longer be business as usual. Chennai crisis is the outcome of being blind to impending changes. Similarly, repeated flooding in Assam shows that authorities there are also unprepared. Given the bouts of extreme rainfall and growing urban sprawls, water storage facilities assume greater importance. This means local accountability has to be enhanced through greater devolution of powers to urban centres. At the same time state governments need to be proactive in solving coordination problems between urban areas and surrounding rural areas where water is to be stored. Simply put, governance structures have to foreground the challenges associated with changing climatic patterns.Agriculture remains the largest user of water in India but policy has rarely acknowledged ecological concerns. We have water guzzling crops like sugarcane and paddy being grown in areas where agro-climatic conditions are not ideal. Policy has to retreat from poorly thought out interventions and move into areas where it can disseminate technology and practices which match cropping pattern with available rainfall patterns. These changes require the Centre to play a coordinating role between states and facilitate greater infusion of technology. While the progress of the southwest monsoon remains a matter of priority – 14% deficiency till July 10 – there should be a concurrent focus on the larger adaptation and mitigation responses.'}]\n"

But in India, with our many forbidding social walls, a woman’s romantic freedom is acutely destabilising, and a lower caste man’s relationship with an upper caste woman is an existential threat.The founders of modern India, like BR Ambedkar, had envisioned intercaste marriage as a solvent of these harsh hierarchies – the state even gives some financial support to such marital unions, to compensate for the assumed lack of family support. But the caste and religious pushbacks have been intense – even now, only 5% of Indian marriages are inter-caste.

Note that the measurement here is not focused on food but living standards – so it reflects an improvement in dimensions like cooking fuel and sanitation as well. India also enjoyed high economic growth in this period. The lesson here is that stronger growth reduces poverty at a faster pace. Moreover, continued growth momentum is needed to move the people lifted out of poverty into the middle class. Else people recently lifted out of poverty could fall back into poverty again, for reasons ranging from macro-economic shocks to health crises within the family.While poverty alleviation attracts much political capital and policy focus, middle India has been neglected by successive governments. Too little is being done to grow their number. More than 90% of workers continue to be employed in the informal sector. The direct fallout of rigid labour laws and other barriers against expanding small businesses into large ones, is that the great swell of middle class jobs that prosperously moved agricultural workers into largescale manufacturing in China and east Asia still hasn’t hit our shores. One hopes we’re not waiting for Godot here.Many Indians who are classified as middle class belong there precariously. The same is the case with many of those lifted out of poverty. As long as jobs and educational opportunities remain scarce, sliding back remains an imminent danger. The only solution is unshackling Indian enterprise, with a forceful pro-growth, pro-trade policy focus. This week the cricket World Cup vividly illustrated to India how much a crumbly middle order can hurt. It must be shored up strongly. Hit a six on reforms.'}]\n",

Trial has commenced in only half of these chargesheets — nearly 6,500 — and verdicts have been reached in just 911 cases. There is no reason for police chargesheets to drag over 90 days and trials more than two months unless the police, courts and forensic labs are overstretched by heavy pendency of cases.

Quite a few rebels were cut up over not becoming ministers. But their willingness to resign just a year after winning a hard fought assembly election does reveal how lightly they value their Congress membership and their prospects in the party that is plumbing historic depths.In contrast, Congress’s ignominy in Goa is linked to the 2017 failure to form a government despite emerging as the single largest party in the assembly. BJP now has a comfortable majority in the house with 27 legislators, and would be in a position to drop its ally Goa Forward Party from the ministry to accommodate the turncoats.The developments are ominous for Congress and it must pay greater attention to Madhya Pradesh where the government runs on a slender majority with support from SP, BSP and independents. BJP is carrying on with its single-minded pursuit of cornering the opposition, unperturbed by allegations of horse trading. ‘Aya Ram, Gaya Ram’ style politics now seems mostly to be about ‘Gaya Ram’.

Access that is time-tested and certified by the government.Only those from media who are accredited by the Press Information Bureau, an arm of the ministry of information and broadcasting, are allowed unscheduled entry to government offices. Accreditation is granted after elaborate screening, including a background check by the police, to a select few from different media organisations. However, the finance ministry has put an end to such access. How an individual ministry is being allowed to unilaterally question and curtail a facility that exists for all ministries and government offices – barring defence, external affairs and the PMO – is for the government to ponder over.Entry into a government office does not guarantee unbridled access and most journalists seek an appointment before meeting officers. Though the stated intent behind finance ministry’s move is to “facilitate and streamline” the entry of journalists, by making it obligatory for the ministry officials to inform the security staff about their meeting with journalists, the decision attempts to mark and pinpoint every official who meets a journalist in office premises.

This comes on the heels of the Union Budget where customs duty on a large number of goods, including newsprint, was hiked. This round of tariff increase is not an isolated development, but one more instance of a recent reversal of long-standing policy. After almost three decades, protectionism has re-emerged as a policy tool to promote domestic manufacturing – ignoring the elementary economic lesson that high import tariffs also act as a tax on exports, reducing the competitiveness of Indian exports.For about two decades world trade has been dominated by global value chains (GVCs). In concrete terms, it meant that emerging markets such as India and Vietnam could become one among many destinations in the manufacture of a sophisticated product. More than two-third of world trade is on account of GVCs, and China is their biggest beneficiary.Resurgence of protectionism is tantamount to rejection of an influential factor that lifted millions out of poverty. Protectionists overlook an intrinsic element of GVCs. Import intensity of economies will usually increase as production is spread across frontiers. A recent report put out by WTO, among others, showed that in almost all countries the share of domestic value added in exports has trended downwards on account of GVCs. Trade data doesn’t capture this adequately. For example, China’s domestic value content of ICT exports is only about half of the total value.The Narendra Modi government’s tariff policy can result in lost opportunities. Japan’s Nintendo this week announced that it will shift a part of its production line out of China to Vietnam to hedge the risks arising from US-China trade friction. Vietnam has embraced greater integration and is one of the big beneficiaries of GVCs. India, on the other hand, is bringing back a policy which it had tried in the past, in the Nehruvian years before liberalisation, and which failed conclusively. Meanwhile, Washington is breathing down New Delhi’s neck and could punish it further after dropping India from its generalised system of preferences; other countries could retaliate against it too. Government must reverse tariff hikes and discard the idea of using them as a policy tool. Make in India will happen, and India get up to $5 trillion by 2024, only if the world comes knocking.'}]\n"

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman observed that India’s external debt to GDP is less than 5%. Also, shifting a part of government’s borrowing to international markets will create more space for private sector loans in India. Sovereign borrowing abroad has been discussed within government for almost three decades, but the idea did not gain traction on account of attendant risks. So, what has changed?Chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian believes it’s a “once in a generation opportunity”. His case rests on three intertwined factors. One, the differential between real interest rate in India and some overseas markets is significant. Therefore, overseas debt will reduce government’s interest cost. Two, the primary deficit is marginal; it’s interest costs which really contribute to fiscal deficit. Three, the exchange rate differential between countries is determined by differences in growth rates. As India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it makes sense to borrow in currencies of economies growing at a much slower rate.The argument is not convincing enough. The explanation on exchange rate differential is about the long run. However, risks of sovereign borrowing emanate from proximate developments. The risk is transmitted through channels which link domestic and foreign markets. To illustrate, India’s deficits are understated, as shown by budget documents and CAG audits. There is a lot of expenditure which doesn’t reflect in the stated deficit numbers because of accounting quirks. In the event of an unfavourable development, the quality of India’s numbers will assume disproportionate importance even if the amount borrowed is small.

The event, a televised national military spectacle, was in stark contrast to the usual community based celebrations that mark the national holiday. Trump’s address – which pledged continued American primacy in the world – was interspersed with a flypast by frontline US military aircraft. Battle tanks and armoured vehicles were present at the site in a clear show of American muscle.In fact, the Salute to America soiree was very similar to India’s Republic Day celebrations. But Americans were divided over the statist and militarised turn that their celebration of a hitherto civic festival has taken. Some criticised the cost of the whole event and asserted that July 4 is actually about celebrating American values. We see a similar debate in India. While for some the military show of might on Republic Day is inconsistent with India’s Gandhian values, others point to India’s tough neighbourhood and the need for security preparedness. China’s thrust for global supremacy has now made America feel the heat as well, with repercussions on how July 4 is celebrated.Nonetheless, the space for criticism and dissent in America remains far bigger as exemplified by a baby Trump balloon that was also parked in the vicinity of the Salute to America event by protesters. Such differences aside, Trump pushed some more India parallels when he alluded to the American ‘army’ taking over airports from the British during the Revolutionary War; a century before humans became airborne. But we in India totally get Trump. After all, we had the vimanas way before America had B-52 bombers. MAGA, MIGA (Make India Great Again) same, same?'}]\n",

Despite a plethora of pro-farmer rhetoric, the same cautious incrementalism marks the budget’s approach to agriculture. Into its sixth year in power the government has struggled to develop a cogent farm policy and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had the opportunity to present a fresh vision. But that will have to wait.In February’s interim budget, stand-in FM Piyush Goyal had signalled a big shift towards “income support” for farmers through the PM-Kisan scheme. But it was also hoped that such direct benefit transfers would transition into investment support that would ultimately subsume market distorting subsidies towards food procurements, fertilisers, electricity and farm loan interest. This isn’t materialising though the PM-Kisan scheme witnessed a near fourfold rise in allocation from Rs 20,000 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 75,000 crore this fiscal. Worrying signs of PM-Kisan hogging the fiscal space without triggering any other structural reforms are evident.Attempts to rationalise the food and fertiliser subsidy could have been made, the Essential Commodities Act that stigmatises food commodities trade needs amendment if not dismantling, and states that take credible initiatives to improve farmers’ market access like scrapping APMCs could be offered generous incentives. The allocation for agricultural R&D – which can produce the biggest bang for every buck invested – has seen only a negligible increase, raising the possibility that PM-Kisan could in future starve investment towards other areas in the farm sector.This is reminiscent of the situation in defence where a huge salary and pensions bill constrains India’s ability to increase capital expenditure for defence modernisation. Recent months have also seen farmers losing patience with government’s irrational moratorium on GM food crops like Bt-Brinjal. With their promise of increased productivity and resistance to pests, farmers cannot be blamed for hoping that GM crops will save them money on inputs and boost incomes. Talk of doubling farm incomes by 2022 is no longer frequent, finding mention once in the budget speech in the context of the quixotic “zero budget farming”. Progressively shrinking the market distorting subsidies can create space for investment and fresh ideas. But that requires political boldness, which this government coming off a phenomenal electoral mandate must muster.'}]\n"

This requires an annual growth of 8% which will have to come on the back of a surge in investment. The Budget’s salient message is that the Narendra Modi government is going to roll out the red carpet for foreign investment in pursuit of its goal. Consequently, key sections of the speech focussed on plans for the capital market. They include debt market reform to encourage foreign and domestic investment, higher FDI limits and looser restrictions on FII investment. Crucially, Sitharaman announced that government will for the first time look at the option of foreign borrowing to bridge its deficit. Strategic disinvestment is also back on the agenda.This path will increase RBI’s challenges. Its relationship with government seems to have improved as it has now been entrusted with greater regulatory power over NBFCs. Housing finance companies have again been brought into its supervisory control. Most of these ideas are still on the drawing board and much will depend on the regulatory fine print. A related development is that NBFCs, a crucial channel to fund consumption and investment, will get a fiscal boost to tide over their liquidity problems.The tax proposals are underwhelming. A small step was taken to lower the headline corporate tax rate to 25%. Companies with a turnover of upto Rs 400 crore, representing 99.3% of base, have been brought into this category. These tentative steps are inconsistent with the goal of attracting large investments in manufacturing. The economy will be better off with a faster transition to lower rates and a phase out of exemptions. This will be a better bet to bring in global companies with the means to establish mega-manufacturing plants in high technology – the Budget instead opted for tax concessions under a special scheme. On the customs duty side, there were a series of tariff increases to promote domestic manufacturing. These tax policies lack coherence given the goal of integrating Indian manufacturing into global value chains. In addition Sitharaman went back to raising indirect taxes on petrol and diesel, likely to have an inflationary impact.The two areas where direct tax policy had clear intent was the use of concessions in personal income tax to promote affordable housing and electric vehicles. Construction has a knock-on effect on many industries and this measure will help mitigate the economic slowdown. Government wants India to capitalise on the inevitable advent of EVs in the mass market. This is where the real challenge comes in. If a fiscal stimulus on the demand side is to also boost local manufacturing, states must work with the Centre to reform factor markets such as land and labour.The Budget arithmetic rests on a forecast of a 12% growth of nominal GDP in 2019-20 to Rs 211 trillion. It’s expected to translate into a modest 9.5% growth in tax collections. The total expenditure is budgeted to increase by 13% to Rs 27.86 trillion. Given NDA’s willingness to borrow abroad, it’s time to take a closer look at the budgetary support coming through public sector enterprises. It’s an unhealthy trend that’s on the rise. Since overseas borrowing or a possible windfall through transfer of RBI reserves are not accounted, meeting the estimated fiscal deficit target of 3.3% is a foregone conclusion. However, the quality of fiscal consolidation does remain worrisome.On balance, the Budget does show clearly that the way forward is to attract foreign savings and investment. However, there isn’t much by way of a coherent fiscal policy. Actualisation of these plans will depend on regulatory details and harmonious federalism.'}]\n",

This takes the Men in Blue to a total of 13 points in the tournament, just one behind Australia who are table toppers at the moment. The Indian campaign so far can be best described as sufficient. Barring a loss against hosts England, the team has played the conditions well. But as the business end of the tournament approaches, Virat Kohli and his boys will do well to plug the gaps.Ironically, it’s India’s famed batting that is showing some infirmities. Although these didn’t completely scuttle the team in the round-robin stage, they could spell trouble for the Men in Blue in the semis or the final. Following opener Shikhar Dhawan’s pullout from the tournament due to injury, the batting line up has been unsettled. The No 4 spot has been a source of worry notwithstanding Rishabh Pant’s promising 48 against Bangladesh. In fact, the batting seems dependent on just two players – Rohit Sharma and skipper Kohli. While Sharma has been having a great tournament and has scored four centuries, Kohli has five 50-plus scores so far.However, if these two have a bad day, it’s unclear which of the other batsmen can bail India out. Veteran MS Dhoni has been India’s lifeguard for many years. But with age no longer on his side, he has failed to get going in this World Cup and has been criticised for wasting too many balls at the wrong time. True, Dhoni still brings a lot of experience and cricketing wisdom to the team. But it’s worth asking if he is blocking a spot for a more dynamic batsman.Thankfully, India’s fielding and bowling have been on point. Pacer Jasprit Bumrah has been the go-to man and has helped India choke the opposition at crucial stages of games. He has also been ably complemented by fellow pacers Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Hardik Pandya too has been a handy all-rounder, accelerating the batting score when required and breaking opposition partnerships with the ball at important junctures.

But these now appear to be stopgap measures given how nearly a third of the 308-metre-long dam was washed away amid copious rainfall and the reservoir filling to capacity. The heavy loss of lives and property demands that accountability be fixed.Failure to do so will only intensify the impunity and negligence that devalues human life. Unlike other unsafe public structures like buildings where risks are localised, failed big dams threaten everything downstream, including other dams, and can have catastrophic domino effects. According to Central Water Commission, India has 5,264 large dams in operation, of which 75% are over 25 years old and 164 big dams more than 100 years old. Until 2018, there were 36 large dam failures, possibly making Tuesday’s Tiware breach the 37th failure.Last year’s Kerala floods were also attributed to poor dam management practices. With extreme weather phenomena making short-term rainfall predictions a challenge despite improved weather forecasting, vigilant dam management is critical for flood mitigation. The Dam Safety Bill 2018 sought to create a legal and institutional framework to ensure proper inspection, surveillance, operation and maintenance of dams but is stalled over some states fearing a central takeover of their dams. These disputes need to be quickly resolved in the interest of the primary stakeholders: citizens at risk. Maharashtra, accounting for the largest chunk of India’s big dams – 2,069 dams – also needs to rethink the utility of big dams amid recurrent droughts which demands age-proof, cost-effective and eco-friendly rainwater storage structures.'}]\n"

The figures are no doubt true, and Mumbai is by no means the only city in the world that floods when it rains 400mm in four hours flat. Yet that’s only half the story.The other half is the exceptionally poor model of urban planning adopted by a once-great city over the past quarter of a century that the Sena has been controlling it. The loss of green cover, of mangroves and other wetlands has been massive. A part of Aarey Colony, a key constituent of the Borivli National Park’s eco-sensitive zone, has been taken for the Metro 3 car shed, and the Sena wants to convert another major part into a zoo, which would mean further erosion of the green lung while the expansion of concrete is uncontrolled across the city.On the very day thousands of Mumbaikars were stranded on trains, inside cars and on waterlogged roads and a wall collapse killed over 20 people, the state auditor’s report highlighted numerous flaws in the city’s flood management system, from conception to engineering and implementation. After the 2005 floods the storm water drain system was overhauled but not satisfactorily enough, and the Mithi river clean-up remains incomplete 14 years after that devastating tragedy made it amply clear that the widening and deepening of the river was key to the city’s survival.

Monetary policy began easing a while ago to combat the slowdown. It’s now government’s turn to come up with solutions.Fiscal policy will have to complement monetary policy.

This precludes the possibility of a stimulus through new spending programmes, financed by either more taxes or higher borrowings.

To start with, a successful sale of Air India will not only generate resources, it will also have a positive impact on sentiment.The budget also needs to lay out a road map on direct tax policy for the remainder of NDA’s term. The US-China trade war offers an opportunity to attract new investment. One ingredient is a tax regime that is both stable and internationally competitive in terms of rates. A compelling need for it is that India can no longer be said to be challenged by a cyclical slowdown. The challenges are visibly structural in nature – the impetus from post-1991 reforms is over.Structural challenges now need to be addressed in conjunction with states. They include reform of factor markets such as land and labour where states exercise significant control. Cooperative federalism will also have to provide the base for solutions to deal with looming ecological challenges such as declining availability of water. One way the budget can contribute to federalism is by avoiding new centrally sponsored schemes which compress a state’s fiscal autonomy. All these solutions cannot come in the first budget.

There are better ways of achieving its objectives.Tailpipe emissions of vehicles have over time been subjected to stringent standards. By next year, the vehicle industry will transition to a higher level, BS VI. A highlight of the Indian two wheeler industry’s transition to more stringent emission standards is that it has been led by domestic companies. India is perhaps the only market where local companies have successfully competed against Japanese firms in the commuter segment. Therefore, it’s reasonable to expect Indian industry to meet more stringent tailpipe emission standards. But what’s unreasonable is to hasten the transition to electric vehicles by using such a crude tool as a ban.Electric vehicles are indeed the future. At this moment however the technology is still at an early stage of development. The dominant battery technology is lithium-ion and Chinese and South Korean companies are among the key manufacturers. Its lack of competitiveness is brought out by the huge subsidy that the Chinese government has to provide to encourage electric vehicle sales there. One way of looking at it is that electric vehicles still cannot compete against those powered by combustion engines in mass market segments.Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar has invoked “national interest” in pushing for the ban. A premature move to electric vehicles will not only have an adverse impact on the large ecosystem supporting the two wheeler industry, it will hand over a bright spot in Indian manufacturing to Chinese firms, among others, on a platter.

But the real question is, why manual scavenging, which is illegal, still continues in several parts of the country, causing deaths with depressing regularity.Given the plethora of mechanical options available and affordable in the 21st century India, it is absolutely inexcusable that human beings are still being made to clean sewer lines and septic tanks, usually without basic safety gear, which is often like sending them into a death trap. Between 2016 and 2018 the Safai Karamchari Andolan puts the casualty figure at 429 deaths in Delhi alone. This despite the fact that the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, bans anyone from employing people to manually clean sewers.Both caste attitudes and lack of technology diffusion are at the heart of the problem. That most manual scavengers are Dalits isn’t just a coincidence. Archaic attitudes towards hygiene and pollution reinforce the prejudice that those who clean sewers and dry pits are themselves unclean. The only way to change this is through faster diffusion of technology. In a modern country machines do the cleaning and those who operate them are known as sanitation engineers. India needs this model to purge the stigma associated with sanitation work and eradicate manual scavenging in 2019.'}]\n",

By showing the existence of “exceptional circumstances and extraordinary situations” where the 50% cap on quotas imposed by Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney case can be breached, the judgment has cleared a path for sundry other reservation demands. Maharashtra has succeeded where Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana governments failed in bestowing quotas on Patidars, Gujjars and Jats respectively because it was able to produce contemporary data on “backwardness, inadequacy of representation” of Marathas and an administrative defence for their quota.In the Sawhney judgment, SC had categorically noted that taking reservations over 50% would violate the right to equality and equality of opportunity and that the framers of the Constitution never envisaged a situation of reservation for a majority of seats. The demands for reservation and “backward” status from dominant groups have risen because overall opportunities have stalled. Even landowning communities are feeling the pinch of agricultural distress. Governments can accede to such demands and enlarge or subdivide the reservation pie as a temporary salve but this doesn’t create more employment or education opportunities.Sooner or later the balloon that is squeezed at one side to inflate another end will burst. Reforms that can unlock land and labour markets for industrialisation and measures to improve learning outcomes in rural India are the need of the hour, not new quotas. True, the verdict is a timely boost for Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ahead of assembly polls. But more importantly, coupled with the Centre’s 10% EWS quota, it has put the 50% cap on notice. Only Supreme Court can save it now.'}]\n",

The recently released UN global report on women shows that a significant number of households in India are headed by single mothers. These tend to be disproportionately poorer than dual-parent households.Whether they are unmarried, divorced, separated or widowed, many women find it difficult to access social security, land rights, resources and policy attention. Unless they are anchored to a family, a household, it is a struggle to get entitlements, whether it is a ration card or a housing allocation. Government policy has to proactively keep this fact in mind (like the MGNREGA does), and officials at every level have to see women as independent, autonomous citizens.Social structures are designed to keep women dependent. While workforce participation of single women is higher than that of married women, it is harder for them to rent a home, their lives are constantly scrutinised. Separated women have minimal rights to support from their estranged partners, divorced women no claim to marital property. These are not favours, these are what is rightly owed to them.

That said, there are issues with India’s No. 4 batting slot. In this match, the team tried out Vijay Shankar who wasn’t able to live up to expectations.

India’s challenge is to safeguard its strategic interests in this setting.US secretary of state Michael Pompeo this week in New Delhi made a case for a tighter trade and defence relationship between the two countries. On trade and investment, US is already India’s largest partner. In defence, ties have been on the upswing. On the heels of the purchase of heavy-lift helicopters by India, the US military for the first time will participate in a tri-service exercise with Indian defence forces this year. In this upbeat backdrop, a tweet by US President Donald Trump yesterday showed why this is a tricky moment in the bilateral relationship. He complained about India’s “high tariffs” and promised to take it up with Modi in Osaka.India, as a member of WTO, harmonises its tariffs and relevant laws with its international obligations. However, this hasn’t been enough for Trump. Increasingly, there are bilateral attempts to bring changes in India’s structure that synchronise with American interests. This is clearly not possible. Therefore, the way out for both sides is to negotiate and arrive at positions which are mutually acceptable. As Pompeo pointed out, neither country will get everything they want. Both sides have to make tradeoffs. Since tradeoffs are a foregone conclusion, the question is the framework within which these should be made.External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that points of friction between the two sides will be discussed in the framework of the big picture. The big picture, as Pompeo observed, is that the two countries share both common interests and values. This is the right framework to help resolve differences. In areas such as flow of data, both sides have common interests. Privacy, for instance, is where there can largely be convergence even while India upholds its legitimate interests. On issues pertaining to Indo-Pacific, the countries have compatible aims. However, on the Indo-Russian missile deal there can be no compromise. Indo-US partnership is one for the long-term.

Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Rajasthan lead among 12 big states showing incremental improvement. But the big worry is that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, among India’s most backward states, are showing marked deterioration.The index has measured 23 wide-ranging health indicators.

Such indicators tell their own story, especially at a time when the leader, Kerala, and one of the laggards, Bihar, found their systems under test.After last year’s Nipah outbreak in which 17 out of 18 infected patients died, although a strong public health response stopped the infection from spreading, Kerala prepared well for the virus’s second coming and there has been no casualty or contagion this time. In dire contrast, failure to learn from repeated outbreaks in Muzaffarpur over two decades has left over 150 young children dead due to acute encephalitis syndrome this month.

These gains wouldn’t have been possible without institutional will at the political or bureaucratic levels and may be replicable.

The amount was supposed to be paid by government for drainage repair work in the village. This is a familiar story across Bengal.

Cut money corruption affects everyday people as corrupt politicians act as gatekeepers to welfare schemes and licences.

In over 10 districts of Maharashtra, some cotton farmers have planted HT Bt cotton. This variety has not yet been approved by the relevant regulatory authorities but is estimated to cover about 15% of the cotton area. In a similar vein, a farmer in Haryana grew Bt brinjal, another unapproved variety. Growing unapproved varieties of crops is the outcome of a decade-long government paralysis.Bt cotton is the only transgenic crop approved for cultivation in India. In the 17 years since it was approved, successive governments have declined to approve any other transgenic crop even after the relevant regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), recommended commercial cultivation. In 2009, GEAC, after a five-year scrutiny, approved commercial cultivation of Bt brinjal. It failed to win an approval at the next stage: political executive. A change of government didn’t matter. In 2017, GEAC approved cultivation of GM mustard, a variety developed at Delhi University. It met with same fate as brinjal.The experience of the last few months in Maharashtra and Haryana has shown that some farmers are no longer willing to pay the price for political paralysis. Indian agriculture is in urgent need of technological infusion. Transgenic crops are the obvious answer. According to government, the regulatory process for approval covers at least six stages. In response to a question from a parliamentary committee, government said that, on average, a proposal from lab stage to decision making on clearances takes at least 10 years. In this backdrop, it’s inexcusable that successive governments have held up political approval on account of fear mongering. The opposition to transgenic crops has increasingly become a matter of faith rather than science.The present situation in Haryana and Maharashtra poses a challenge. By driving the infusion of technology underground, government has created a problem of its own making. A farmers’ organisation, Shetkari Sanghatana, has come out in support of farmers who are growing transgenic crops without approval.

Surveys conducted by CSDS-Lokniti after the 2019 poll suggest that while BSP remains popular with its core social base, it is struggling to persuade a wider cross-section of voters. Over 75% of Jatavs, BSP’s core, voted for the alliance. However, almost half the Dalits belonging to other categories supported BJP. This indicates the narrowness of BSP’s durable support base.Mayawati hasn’t put her best foot forward in dealing with this situation. Her response included appointing her brother as party vice-president and his son as national coordinator. The optics are negative, especially for BSP which has risen on the back of a dedicated cadre.

The reality that’s been exposed is that there’s something rotten about the public health infrastructure of the state. The epicentre of the outbreak, Muzaffarpur district, is extremely underequipped to deal with any public health emergency. Its Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital, where more than 100 children have died due to AES, has been overwhelmed with patients being forced to share beds. Reportedly it also lacks basics such as adequate drinking water and uninterrupted electricity.The high patient load at the hospital follows from the abysmal state of primary health centres in Muzaffarpur. In fact, of the 103 PHCs in the district 98 could not even meet the minimum criteria for evaluation under the health ministry’s health management information system. And of the remaining five, every single one got a rating of zero. All of this has created the recipe for the AES disaster. What’s even more shocking is that there’s no definitive answer to what is causing the outbreak. While much has been written about the toxic effect of eating litchi on undernourished children – the fruit is apparently a trigger for AES – others believe that high temperatures and humidity in the district are to blame.The confusion about the root cause persists despite the fact that Bihar sees AES outbreaks regularly. Most of the affected children come from very poor families, who neither have adequate knowledge of the disease nor are able to receive timely administration of oral glucose at local PHCs. Most of the deaths involve children in the age group of 2-3.5 years who are undernourished. State failure at multiple levels includes failure of ICDS and other food schemes.This is a huge indictment of the Nitish Kumar-led administration in Bihar which has been in place since 2005.

The third letter has sought the revival of tenure appointments of retired SC and HC judges, so that they can be assigned long pending cases.The high rate of pendency in our courts weakens justice with inordinate delays and legal costs. These in turn undermine the entire criminal justice system which loses its efficacy and deterrence value. Thus, the huge backlog of cases does need to be addressed on a war footing. Towards this end, CJI’s suggestion of raising the retirement age of HC judges to 65 years needs to be worked upon immediately. For, the 25 high courts in the country currently face a shortage of 399 judges or 37% of the sanctioned strength. Bringing the retirement age here on a par with that of SC judges will help address vacancies and reduce case backlogs.Further increasing the retirement age of SC judges should also be considered. That said, CJI’s suggestion of increasing the bench strength of the Supreme Court seems less promising. True, the apex court only recently achieved its full strength of 31 judges and has a pendency of more than 58,000 cases. But the apex court should ideally concern itself with matters of the Constitution. Equally important, if the work of helping the lower levels of judiciary function well is well done, SC pendency will automatically reduce.But the third suggestion of having tenure appointments of retired SC and HC judges is, again, welcome. These temporary appointments will help bring down pendency, though care needs to be taken to ensure that these judges don’t go on to obtain government sinecures. Overall, timely appointment of judges is key to tackle case backlogs.

However this appeal turns out, two related aspects of Thursday’s sentence need to be highlighted. It has taken an extraordinarily long time for the case to reach closure at a lower court, partly on account of the state government withholding permission for prosecution. And data shows that of the 1,557 custodial deaths between 2001 and 2016, convictions were rarely seen.Custodial deaths are unacceptable. India is a signatory to the UN Convention against torture, which makes custodial deaths a violation of the principles the country professes. One possible reason for the incidence of custodial deaths is that 22 years after India signed the UN Convention, the legal process of its ratification hasn’t been completed. This indicates that acting against torture is a low priority for the political class. It shouldn’t be. A clampdown on custodial torture is needed for its own sake. In addition, a legislation against torture will have another important benefit. It will strengthen India’s legal case when it seeks to extradite fugitives from jurisdictions which take a dim view of custodial torture.In 2017, the law commission recommended that India ratify its UN obligation against torture by creating a legislative framework. There has been progress since then as the Centre has asked state governments for inputs on the legislation. It should translate into a watertight law.

Naidu has just suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of YSR Congress Party in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh. TDP was reduced to just three Lok Sabha seats out of 25 and a mere 23 assembly seats out of 175.What added insult to injury was the fact that Naidu was at the forefront of efforts to stitch together a grand opposition coalition for the Lok Sabha polls. But TDP’s rout in Andhra means that he was out of sync with his own electorate. Perhaps even on the task of building a new capital city for the state. Naidu’s grand plans for Amaravati have yet to materialise amidst a capital crunch and failure to secure special category status for Andhra. Thus, Naidu needs to go back to the drawing board and reinvent his party.This isn’t impossible since TDP more or less retains its Kamma base in Andhra. Plus, new chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy and his YSRCP will face some of the same problems that Naidu did. Amaravati still needs to be built and if Naidu couldn’t secure a deal from the Modi government when he was a member of NDA, Jagan will find it harder when BJP has returned at the Centre with a bigger mandate. Perhaps the real factor affecting Andhra is India’s overall economic growth. If the latter is robust and private investments revive, Andhra can look to a bright future.

The woman has now been arrested for staging an assault on herself with the help of her lawyer, to further defame Oberoi. The case appears to indicate misuse of the current rape law, which is increasingly becoming common in instances where relationships end on a bitter note. In fact, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016 and in 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage.This is problematic as it suggests that the rape law, as it stands, is being commonly used as a tool for blackmail, harassment or to settle scores in failed relationships. Following the heinous Nirbhaya rape case in 2012, responding to the huge public outcry against the horrific rape and murder, Parliament enacted several amendments to the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and the Code of Criminal Procedure. These changes included widening the definition of rape to include some forms of molestation and introducing the concept of presumption of no consent in judging rape cases.This meant that consent had to be explicitly given to escape punishment for rape, which leaves room open for wide interpretation. And this in turn has seen judges interpret no consent to include reneging on the promise of marriage. In a case that came up before it, the Supreme Court has clarified that rape cannot be invoked in cases of consensual sex after a relationship ends. However, as the Oberoi case shows, the wording of the rape law and policing practice on the ground can overturn a basic principle of Indian jurisprudence – that one is innocent until proven guilty. Instead, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to prove his innocence.This not only goes against the principle of natural justice but also trivialises rape – often enabling the real rapists to get away. Laws need to be differentiated rather than draconian, making room for a vast spectrum of possible sexual behaviours, misdemeanours and crimes. The Nirbhaya amendments were a knee-jerk reaction to cover up deficiencies in the policing system, and some of them may need review. Administrative deficiencies cannot be made up for by over-legislating, however well meant such legislation might be. Gender neutral laws will help by reducing incentives to game the system.'}]\n"

Through its emphasis on improving India’s ranking in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business exercise, the Narendra Modi government has implicitly recognised this. Now, there are plans to move further in this direction by simplifying procedures for neighbourhood shops and eateries, two areas which generate a substantial number of jobs and small-scale businesses. This is an important step in creating a benign environment for entrepreneurs.Evidence of the absurdity of India’s licensing regime is all around us. In Delhi, for example, a Subway eatery serving sandwiches needs to submit 24 different documents to the police. Compared to that, anyone seeking to buy a weapon needs to submit only 13 documents. It is therefore unsurprising that small businesses struggle to deal with regulatory needs. While the government’s plan to cut back on licensing is praiseworthy, it needs support from state governments. It’s only when both levels of government synchronise their policies that the licence raj at street level can be curbed.None of these steps suggest all regulations will be eliminated. Externalities arising from economic activities make regulatory intervention essential. What is needed is a smarter approach which has a sharper focus and is mindful of state capacity. To illustrate, regulatory intervention to account for fire hazards in a crowded marketplace is essential. This should translate into identifying essential areas of regulation and doing that well.

Now five economists, Bibek Debroy, Rathin Roy, Surjit Bhalla, Charan Singh and Arvind Virmani, have rejected Subramanian’s methodology and conclusions, and have even accused the latter of bias against the Central Statistics Office.However, there have been some doubts about India’s economic data.

This too was refuted by the government saying that the unemployment data was incomplete and only a draft. Subsequently, the ministry of statistics and program implementation pegged joblessness at 6.1% — tallying with the NSSO data.

It is about 27 years since private sector participation was invited into railway operations, with schemes such as own your wagon. Since then there have been other attempts to invite private participation in railways. But the record has been patchy, due to resistance from entrenched interests. It must be done right this time.It is four years since a committee headed by Bibek Debroy submitted a comprehensive report to the government on ways to restructure railways. The report included recommendations on preliminary steps which need to be taken to allow private operators of passenger trains. However, there has been scant progress since then. With a renewed mandate, the Narendra Modi government must now move swiftly.It is over two years since the relevant approvals were received to establish a Rail Development Authority, an independent sector regulator to create a positive environment for investments. Such a regulator must be set up quickly because its presence will be essential to attract private investment. Currently, Indian Railways handles both policy issues and operations. In this situation, an independent regulator will be a prerequisite to give confidence to potential private bidders on account of the conflict of interest. Also, passenger pricing is largely subsidised today. A smooth transition to a competitive framework in operation of passenger trains may need regulatory intervention to start with.The railway ministry is expected to take its unions into confidence while finalising the plan. It is necessary to make sure that misapprehensions do not derail the plan to introduce competition in running passenger trains. Unlike the last occasion, it is important for railway minister Piyush Goyal to use the political capital of the government to overcome vested interests. The Debroy report had suggested a long-term transition to an operating framework which envisaged bifurcating railways into two parts. One, which owned and maintained the infrastructure.

But this time the exercise is expected to be more comprehensive with the police stations being judged on seven parameters such as crime prevention, proactive measures adopted, and citizens’ perception and feedback. The overall goal here is to spur competition between police stations and create incentives to improve policing. While this is indeed an innovative approach, attention also needs to be directed towards the resource crunch that a large number of police stations grapple with across the country.For example, expenditure on police accounts for just around 3% of central and state government budgets. As of January 2016 – and little improvement has been made since then – state police forces had 24% vacancies. Thus, while the sanctioned police strength was 181 policemen per lakh persons, the actual strength was just 138 per lakh. This is in stark contrast to the UN recommended standard of 222 policemen per lakh persons. The manpower shortage means that police personnel are often overburdened, affecting the overall quality of policing. This in turn translates into poor police-public relations in large parts of the country.Additionally, police forces are saddled with administrative and structural deficiencies ranging from obsolete weaponry and shortage of police vehicles to poor communication networks and technological inputs. Both the Police Telecommunication Network, which is used in crime investigation and transmission of crime-related data, and the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System, which is supposed to link every police station, are yet to be implemented in certain states.

This is a commendable goal and a logical followup to the Swachh Bharat programme. Ensuring piped water to every household is at the heart of the overarching aim of governments to improve the quality of life for every Indian. To actualise this goal, Modi took an important step by integrating the government’s water management efforts.The newly created Jal Shakti Mantralaya – to be helmed by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat – consolidates water policy and management, which had till recently been spread across seven ministries. According to one estimate, only around one in five rural households has a piped water connection. Within this, there is noticeable regional disparity. In this context, it is important the Centre adopts a coordinated approach to the problem. From a political standpoint, it helps that both Centre and states such as UP and Bihar, which lag the national average in piped water connections, have governments run by BJP and its allies.The scale of the challenge for the government this time is even more complex than Swachh Bharat. Linking every household through taps to a collective source of water requires the state to be involved at every step. By way of comparison, building toilets could be hastened through financial subsidies provided to relevant households. Now, Centre and states have to work in conjunction. We need to witness greater government participation at all levels of project implementation. Even as the focus is on rural households, governments cannot lose sight of the fact that many urban slums are largely dependent on hand pump, each one shared by many households. The aim must be comprehensive coverage.Piped water needs to be located in the larger policy context of easing India’s water stress. At a per capita level, water availability has been declining. Piped water projects therefore represent an approach which can harness technology to augment water conservation. To illustrate, Israel recycles around 94% of water it uses. Recycling can increase water availability even in times of rainfall deficiency. This can end the perennial water crises Chennai suffers, for instance.

Bengal’s public health system has, for all practical purposes, collapsed. The situation remains unsettled on account of an impasse between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and protesting junior doctors, according to whom Mamata is siding with the vigilantes rather than protecting doctors. Doctors in other states too went on strike. This may be out of solidarity with doctors under assault in Bengal, but also due to anxiety about their situation. After all, political populism is not confined just to Bengal.The turmoil among doctors can be seen as symptoms of two systemic issues. One, the breakdown of law and order in Bengal. Even after Lok Sabha polls, political violence in the state has continued unabated. The assault on junior doctors at NRS reflects a deeper malaise in the state’s governance. Mamata now needs to go the extra mile to defuse the situation and get doctors back into hospitals. It needs to be accompanied by an effort to restore order in the state and ensure doctors receive adequate police protection.The other systemic issue relates to shortage of medical professionals, an outcome of bad policy. Government data shows that India’s doctor-population ratio is 1:1472 compared to WHO’s minimum norm of 1:1000. It’s estimated that there are less than a million active doctors in India. In a backdrop of general scarcity, prevailing policies make matters worse. There is a growing incidence of non-communicable disease, but some important ones can legally be treated only by specialists. However, Indian medical education system is not geared to enhance the number of specialists. This can be fixed by sensible de-licensing.India has around 600 district hospitals which can be upgraded to teaching hospitals. In a similar vein, other solutions to increase the supply of doctors have come from the medical fraternity. Another way to enhance supply is to provide a pathway for experienced nurses to deal with basic problems. Tackling supply shortage calls for long-term reforms and curtailing MCI’s power. The immediate need however is to restore law and order in Bengal and assure doctors everywhere that violence against them will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable to have patients become collateral damage.'}]\n"

Additionally, five persons, including the SHO of Anantnag Sadar police station, were injured in the attack.

For example, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation are all the same organisation headed by proscribed terrorist Hafiz Saeed. But every time a new alias is created, much bureaucratic effort is expended on establishing its link to the original terror group. This not only provides the terror outfit room to continue its operations under the new name, but also gives the Pakistani establishment reason to legally withhold action against the group. Not that they needed much justification in the first place, given the military-ISI complex’s use of terror as an instrument of state policy.The Anantnag attack shows that despite the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Air Force to avenge Pulwama, eliminating terrorism emanating from Pakistan will be a long-drawn battle. There are multiple terror channels through which Pakistan can strike, and India has to continuously remain on guard. After all, terror has become transnational today with multiple forces at play.

The Indian Space Research Organisation also grabbed its slice of glory with Mangalyaan, for making it to the red planet on its first shot and at a bargain basement price. Now Chandrayaan 2 will soft-land a rover to gather intel on the Moon, unravelling its mysteries while also boosting ties with Nasa. It has a far more complex mission than Chandrayaan 1 which only included an orbiter and an impactor. Most importantly, this is all building up to the ambitious Gaganyaan project, where India is targeting a manned mission to space by 2022.In a country where gender inequality continues to drag down social and economic progress, what is quite remarkable about Chandrayaan 2 is that this interplanetary mission has a woman project director and a woman mission director. In fact women comprise around 30% of the team in charge of the mission. Even during earlier Isro missions like Mangalyaan, the launch images grabbed attention for the number of women in the control room. Not only does this break worldwide stereotypes of rocket science being the domain of men, it offers an encouraging glimpse of Indian organisations that do right by women and are much the better for it.Once upon a time space missions could be considered national vanity projects. Today they are an existential necessity. Because satellites today control a countless number of critical Earth functions such as communications and weather mapping. Given the reality that space is no longer a distinct entity outside human lives, it is welcome that India and Isro are upping their space game. This is a national security imperative now.

About 42% of the country is abnormally dry – 6% more than last year. Add to this a delay in the onset of monsoon and circumstances are indeed grim.All of this is the cumulative effect of poor water management and climate change. While an IMD study has found a threefold increase in heatwaves every year since 1991, perennial rivers such as Cauvery, Krishna and Godavari have seen a significant drop in their flows, and hundreds of small, seasonal rivers are perishing permanently. Plus water usage has become unsustainable. For example, while Maharashtra faces drought conditions, sugarcane acreage there shot up to 11.63 lakh hectare last year as compared to 9.02 lakh hectare in 2017.Meanwhile, the underground water table has severely depleted in several regions, creating acute water shortages in cities – Bengaluru being a prime example – as well as rural areas like arid Bundelkhand. In fact, it is projected that over the coming years there will be a deficit of 43% between water availability and requirement, increasing to 50% by 2030 unless usage patterns change.

Calling it a “glaring case of deprivation of liberty”, SC also took exception to a magistrate remanding Kanojia to custody until June 22.The custodial remand was unfortunate.

In recent research work, he concluded that India’s GDP growth has been over-estimated by about 2.5 percentage points year in five years since 2011-12. When this is juxtaposed with an ongoing slowdown in the official GDP estimate, a high level of unemployment and a demand slump, the unmistakable signal is of an economy in trouble.We are not in the midst of a cyclical downswing. India’s growth potential has clearly fallen as the benefits of the 1990s economic reforms are behind us. What’s needed now is a new generation of economic reforms which will unleash productive forces. A measure of its success will be its ability to absorb much larger numbers from agriculture into more productive sectors such as manufacturing and services. Unlike in the past, unleashing a new wave of reforms is politically doable now as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has received an overwhelming mandate to transform India.The next wave of reforms must of course include markets for factors of production such as land and labour. Beyond that, Modi must use his unmatched political capital to move India away from a beloved shibboleth that small is ideal. Manufacturing in India is seldom globally competitive as economies of scale are insufficient – even Ganesh idols must be procured from China. It partly stems from an unwarranted level of protection lent to small scale firms which makes it difficult for them to compete on either cost or quality.The clamour for protectionism stems from the obstacles to scaling up. If these obstacles arising from inflexible factor markets are removed, the political compulsion for protection will cease. In this context, there is an unforeseen opportunity arising on account of the US-China trade war. As multinational companies look for new destinations to situate their production lines, India should reform rapidly to capitalise on this opportunity.

The latter granted Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under China’s ‘one country, two systems’ mechanism. This ensured that Hong Kong remained one of Asia’s top financial hubs with a vibrant capitalist economic system. However, over the years, China has slowly chipped away at Hong Kong’s autonomy, increasing Beijing’s hold over the territory.In fact, from viewing Hong Kong as a growth engine Beijing has moved to perceiving the territory as one that must be knit more closely with the mainland.

In March, India had launched an anti-satellite (A-Sat) missile to take down an imaging satellite creating a measure of deterrence for vital Indian interests in space that include communications, navigation, earth observation and surveillance satellites. Subsequently, a tri-service Defence Space Agency is taking shape which could even become a Space Command when its space war capabilities mature.Like in other areas, China has a head start demonstrating its A-Sat capabilities in 2007 and only some days ago launching multiple satellites from a ship at sea. India’s civilian space programme is going great guns, with a human spaceflight and a lunar landing on the anvil. But for too long there has been ambivalence towards channelling some of these advances towards defence requirements, due to residual ‘pacifist’ considerations. However India lives in a tough neighbourhood, sharing borders with nations such as Pakistan and China who are, moreover, specialists in asymmetric warfare. They will look to probe India’s weaknesses rather than play to its strengths.In future, it could be cyber warfare or space that is used to cripple us if we do not bolster capabilities in these areas. Such changing paradigms also negate the need for a large standing army and even make weaponry like battle tanks 20th century vintage. It is commendable that the Integrated Defence Staff will oversee the space war exercise. But it is unfortunate that we are still a long way away from a unified military command.Countries like the US and China have seen the operational advantages of integrating the army, air force and navy into various theatres under a single command. Military modernisation is the need of the hour in India, but progress is slow. Too much money is being spent on salaries and pensions, leaving precious little for acquisitions or technology development. General Bipin Rawat’s attempts to trim the army met stiff resistance from within. Shifting focus to cyber and space warfare is also an opportunity to rope in the private sector and create a large vendor pool that can address India’s future defence acquisition needs. Above all, the government must gear the armed forces to fight the battles of this century – rather than the last one.'}]\n"

The vote for the reduction was unanimous. However, it was RBI’s analysis accompanying the reduction which put matters in perspective. The economy’s growth impulses have weakened significantly over the last few months. The evidence of an economic slowdown is overwhelming and addressing it is top priority. Therefore, along with a reduction in interest rate, RBI changed its monetary policy stance to signal that a rate increase is off the table.The positive development this week is that RBI is no longer fighting a solitary battle in dealing with the slowdown. Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week set up two separate cabinet committees to deal with revival of growth and address deficits in jobs and skills respectively. This suggests that government and RBI are on the same page. Consequently, fiscal and monetary policies should pull in the same direction.Monetary policy has now shifted focus to economic growth because in RBI’s estimate inflation this year will remain low, but economic growth will lose a bit of momentum. For the first half of 2019-20, the economy is forecast to grow in the range of 6.4% to 6.7%. The cumulative effect of RBI’s three rate cuts since February should soon lead to lower borrowing costs. For savers, fixed deposit rates are likely to trend down. What matters now is the speed with which RBI’s policy signals transmit through the rest of the economy. So far, the record has been mixed. Fresh loans since February have been disbursed at lower interest rates. However older loans, on average, recorded a marginal increase in interest rates. This does point to issues other than level of RBI’s policy rates which are acting as a drag.For almost a year, the non-banking financial intermediaries have been under stress. Imprudent lending by some firms has had a ripple effect. Consequently, the impact of RBI’s actions may be muted. In this context, the cabinet committee on growth and investment should play a proactive role in removing bureaucratic or policy roadblocks for investment proposals. Compressing the lag between investment in a project and its actualisation will complement the monetary stance. In conjunction, they will reduce the costs associated with investment and, thereby, reverse the current economic slowdown. An attendant benefit will be the generation of more job opportunities.'}]\n"

The alliance did transfer votes to each other in most seats, but Mayawati will know that the marginal rise in parliamentary presence will do BSP no good. In terms of vote share, SP and BSP are still stuck at their 2014 and 2017 performances, hovering in and around 20%, while BJP has leapt from the 40% mark to nearly 50% in 2019.The party that can bridge this gap with BJP will emerge as the main opposition in UP. But to achieve that end both SP and BSP will have to reimagine their politics. Politics based on reservations and caste grievances have been upended by Modi, whose Hindu nationalist appeal coupled with emphasis on strong governance is a move away from the caste patronage politics of the Congress-SP-BSP era. BJP has also used the shrinking reservation pie and political dominance of Jatavs, Yadavs and Muslims in SP and BSP to create an umbrella Hindu social coalition of upper castes, non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits.BSP’s personality cult centred on Mayawati and SP’s complete identification with the Mulayam Singh clan may inhibit organisational and ideological changes needed to meet the new political challenges. BJP’s refrain of corruption during Mayawati’s tenure and anarchy under SP governments needs a counter narrative that coalitions based on caste arithmetic cannot offer. When Modi signals his OBC background and talks of only two castes – the poor and those who wish to help the poor – he is much ahead of the curve. Younger voters are showing little patience for backward identity politics with caste hierarchies being smashed by urbanisation, occupational mobility, education and technology.

One indicator of change finally picking up pace is that 10 cities now have functional metro rail networks and more are lined up to hop on soon. Any retardation of this progress will be nothing less than tragic.Unfortunately, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has plumped for the old povertarian approach to building infrastructure by proposing that women should travel for free in city public transport, including the metro.

But in a country with over 10 lakh teacher vacancies, where language teachers are being tasked with say handling mathematics as well, and where acceptable reading levels are often not to be found in even one language, a centrally mandated three language policy is quite pointless.

All this is because English is accused of lacking ‘apnapan’ and being the language of elites. But if that’s the case, shouldn’t it follow that it should no longer be the preserve of elites alone?

In many places this intense heat spell is expected to last the week.So this is a week in which state governments must pay special attention to the NDMA guidelines for managing heat waves. This includes reordering work and school timings as needed, setting up public cooling places, ensuring uninterrupted water and electricity supplies even while discouraging wastage, coordinating mitigation efforts with NGOs, and ensuring the healthcare system gives a trustworthy response to complaints of heat exhaustion. It is about getting the basics right.Read full story:\\xa0Water-starved Chennaiites shift houses, visit kin in Bengaluru and KeralaRead full story:\\xa0Rains delayed, India sees 2nd driest pre-monsoon in 65 years'}]\n",

They fear that this is a precursor to making the learning of Hindi mandatory across the country. Recall that several anti-Hindi agitations have rocked the state since the late 1930s against various governmental attempts to introduce Hindi learning.The Centre has moved quickly to allay the fears of Tamil politicians pointing out that this was just a draft and no decision has been taken. While the draft does not mandate Hindi learning it takes enough potshots at English, which it says is spoken by just 15% of the population and is the language of the “elite” while noting that Hindi has 54% native speakers. The draft goes on to complain that non-proficiency in English by educated native language speakers have affected their prospects in life.The anti-English tenor of the draft recalls old policy blunders like the Left regime in Bengal mandating Bengali as the language of instruction. The promotion of English along with Hindi as link languages in the 1960s also allowed the cooling of tempers in Tamil Nadu where the Dravidian movement had reached its peak and India’s integrity was under threat. The gains made by South India during the information technology boom also rested partly on its greater adoption of English.And yet Hindi has spread across India, not by government diktat but cultural intermingling. Bollywood, migrant workers and tourism has taken Hindi to the deep south states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka just as people from non-Hindi speaking areas quickly picked up the language when they moved for work to the Hindi heartland. A missionary zeal to “teach” Hindi, on the other hand, creates unnecessary tensions even as the language continues to seamlessly find new speakers. Rather, focus on learning outcomes and teaching quality so that our children make a better life for themselves.'}]\n",

She had a tough baptism on Friday – data showed a marked economic slowdown in the backdrop of a high level of unemployment. There was bad news on the external front too as US President Donald Trump announced that he will end a trade benefit package to India. Therefore, not only does NDA-3 have to craft its first budget in the context of a slowdown, new welfare spending has to be accommodated. It calls for bold decisions.GDP growth for 2018-19 was 6.8%, the slowest in five years. Even the quarterly GDP number (January-March) was disappointing. There’s been a sequential slowdown over four consecutive quarters. In the last quarter it was pronounced in agriculture, manufacturing and construction, sectors which provide most Indians with a livelihood. Unemployment for the year ended June 2018 was 6.1% and subsequent loss of economic momentum would have further hurt. Also, India’s export intensity of economic growth has declined over five years and the Trump administration’s decision adds to the challenge.Finance ministry believes the stress that non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have been subjected to in the last nine months has caused the slowdown. That is likely to have been the case. However, this stress may also impede quick recovery. The stress that NBFCs are under has pushed up their borrowing costs and also had a cascading impact. The fallout of the stress in the financial sector can make loans more expensive for everyone on account of higher risk premiums. Consequently, even if RBI lowers its policy rate, transmission across the economy may be muted. In this situation, where will the push for higher economic growth come from?Public investment is one area which can propel the economy. However, India has no case for loosening its fiscal stance. Combined fiscal deficits of the Centre and states remained almost unchanged between 2014-18. Moreover, CAG reports have pointed out that the Centre has understated its expenditure on subsidies. In this situation, the way out is to embark on a privatisation programme. Not only will it help government raise revenue without new taxes and additional borrowing, it will lift sentiments. A marquee privatisation exercise like the sale of Air India can meet immediate challenges even as NDA takes up the task of reforming markets for factors of production like land and labour.'}]\n",

Meeting these challenges became just a little bit easier with a phenomenal mandate that will ensure a stable and strong government for the next five years. Yet even a dominant government can end up with a stint in power that’s ordinary or worse. This is where Modi has been gifted a second opportunity by voters to chart a more purposeful course. The fresh mandate is not just for continuity; the emphatic nature of the NDA victory is a green signal from the electorate for Modi to bite the reform bullet.Various political and regional compulsions have driven the composition of the new council of ministers. But the dropping of 40% of the old ministers sends a warning signal of sorts to the new crop. While Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj made an exit due to health reasons, it is notable that many non-performers and motor mouths have been axed. The big entrant to the Cabinet this time is undoubtedly Amit Shah after an impressive run as BJP president. Shah must beef up internal security, especially in the aftermath of the Colombo blasts, and work with state governments to push police reforms, which will improve general law and order.From top mandarin to ‘mantri’ in South Block, S Jaishankar is an inspired choice to be India’s foreign minister. With his stints as ambassador to US and China, Jaishankar’s strategic heft will be an asset for the PM amid a fluid and dynamic global situation, with the US-China trade war and perhaps a looming Cold War transforming settled paradigms in international affairs. Foreign affairs has been the one breakthrough area for the Modi government in its previous avatar, but the ground is shifting fast.Unlike Shah or Jaishankar, Nirmala Sitharaman’s transition from defence to finance will not enthuse economy watchers who would have preferred a performer like Piyush Goyal in this bellwether ministry. She assumes charge at a particularly difficult time when GDP growth has dipped to 5.8%, a 17-quarter low, and the bad loans pandemic has spread to NBFCs. Yet, with political backing from the PM, Sitharaman has an opportunity like Manmohan Singh in 1991 to unveil economic reforms that liberalise the land, labour, capital markets. She must also pursue disinvestment, simplify GST, ease credit flow to industries, reduce import tariffs, and leverage export opportunities thrown up by the US-China trade war. One only hopes she can seize the moment and utilise these opportunities decisively.Rather than centralising power in the PMO, Modi must use his authority to delegate responsibilities and demand accountability. Given the vastness of India, it is unrealistic to expect Modi to single-handedly deliver the goods. Moreover, BJP hasn’t been able to dispel perceptions of a paucity of talent. The exits of Urjit Patel and Arvind Subramanian did send wrong signals. This is where Jaishankar’s induction hits the right notes. Domain expertise offers answers to the critical challenges of our time like doubling farm incomes and combating climate change. If paucity of talent is a problem, more lateral entrants such as Jaishankar must be brought in.The new government takes charge with opposition at its weakest. It should refrain from heavy handed actions, bolster institutions like Supreme Court and CBI, and pursue harmonious relations with opposition parties and state governments. Restoring the Indian economy’s mojo, lost somewhere in the early part of this decade, must be the abiding focus of this government. Success here will seal Modi’s legacy in the annals of independent India.\\xa0'}]\n"

Reportedly, she was miffed at BJP inviting the kin of political victims of the party from Bengal. Against all evidence, Mamata asserts that no such political murders have taken place. In fact, not only has she made tall claims about hundreds of Trinamool Congress workers having been displaced in BJP-led violence since the Lok Sabha poll results, yesterday she sat on a dharna in Naihati demanding that these party workers be allowed to return home. Ironically, even her counterclaim reflects poorly on the quality of governance in Bengal.The state became a fierce political battleground in this election. BJP made huge inroads here, picking up 18 of the 42 seats on offer, just four behind Trinamool. This translates into BJP taking the lead in 129 assembly segments. With state elections due in 2021, these are ominous signs for Mamata. However, instead of properly analysing the causes for the loss in her support base, she appears inclined to return to street fighter mode. She is now looking for ‘traitors’ who helped transfer votes from Trinamool to BJP, or from CPM to BJP at Trinamool’s expense.The authoritarian mindset fails to reflect upon its own mistakes. While BJP benefited from some religious polarisation in Bengal, Mamata’s dictatorial ways also helped. From taking police action against those sharing material critical of her on social media to intimidating political opponents, Trinamool has essentially taken over the Left’s legacy of political violence in Bengal. The last straw may have been the Bengal panchayat polls last year that saw widespread allegations of Trinamool strong arm tactics.If Mamata is to recover lost ground, she must rectify her own party workings and arrest the perception that she condones violence in her party’s interest. Instead of brushing aside accusations of Trinamool functionaries propagating an extortion syndicate across the state, she must investigate such complaints fairly. In fact, Mamata can take a leaf out of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s book. The latter successfully fended off the BJP challenge in his state by focussing on deliverables rather than embarking on a bitterly antagonistic relationship with the Centre. Patnaik’s pitch for constructive cooperation with the central government is something that Mamata too should look at even while trying to strengthen her base in Bengal.'}]\n",

Modi’s first term was spent on political consolidation, which has been achieved by now. Going for blockbuster, double digit growth that makes India a pre-eminent power and ushers in ‘acche din’ for Indians is a worthy aim for the second term.Speaking for BJP ally Akali Dal Naresh Gujral, who also chairs the parliamentary standing committee on commerce, has strongly advocated bold economic reforms for the government. As Gujral suggests, Margaret Thatcher transformed the UK economy from being the “sick man of Europe” to a ferociously competitive one through bold reforms: Modi can do the same for India. In which case the current moment – when the NDA government is set to enjoy a honeymoon period, Modi stands unchallenged and the opposition is in disarray – is the best time to act.India’s economic reforms in 1991 focussed on enhancing competition in the market for products by opening it up to the private sector. The next stage of reforms needs to play out in the market for factors of production such as land, labour and capital. Unless these areas see reform, Indian manufacturing and services are unlikely to be globally competitive. Legislative powers over factor markets, particularly land and labour, are divided between Centre and states. Therefore, comprehensive reform requires both levels of government to work together and remove onerous regulations.Unless the land market is unlocked, Indian manufacturers will be unable to scale up to global levels. This must be complemented by imparting flexibility in the labour market, which will pave the way for more labour intensive manufacturing and jobs. India needs to take a leaf out of Vietnam’s playbook. In a space of about three decades, it has moved from collectivised agriculture to another Asian tiger in the making on the back of market-oriented reforms. Agriculture is another area crying out for market-oriented policy. There’s no time to waste if Modi’s earlier promise of “minimum government, maximum governance” is to be realised.

Apart from India, Bimstec comprises Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan. This leaves out Pakistan and suggests an eastward turn in New Delhi’s priorities. After all, though then Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif had attended Modi’s swearing-in in 2014, this failed to produce satisfactory results on the bilateral front.On the contrary, tensions with Pakistan over the last five years have effectively resulted in Islamabad closing off New Delhi’s access to west Asia. Thus, India is better off building bridges to the east where there are greater chances of reaping benefits from trade and connectivity. Bimstec can serve as a bridge between India and Southeast Asia as represented by Asean. The latter has experienced high economic growth over the last three decades and is perceived as the next global growth hub. Plus, India shares ancient ties with this region as exemplified by the spread of both Hinduism and Buddhism. If India’s Act East policy is to actualise, Bimstec needs to be given greater priority in New Delhi’s foreign policy.As far as Saarc is concerned, there’s no reason why India should bear the guilt of the South Asian body being put on the back burner. Pakistan hasn’t kept its word vis-a-vis Saarc. For example, the South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta) agreement was inked between Saarc members in 2004. However, Pakistan never gave India Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) status, effectively stymieing regional trade, even though New Delhi had extended the courtesy to Islamabad in 1996 – it recently withdrew the status after the Pulwama terror attack. Therefore, if Islamabad is serious about South Asian integration, it should first take steps to implement the aims of Safta.Till then, India should further its Act East goals. This is also commensurate with India’s growing geopolitical profile. Thus, the focus on sub-regional connectivity through initiatives like BBIN (Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal) and the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway is welcome. However, to actualise these projects New Delhi needs to overcome its reputation of promising much but delivering little.
