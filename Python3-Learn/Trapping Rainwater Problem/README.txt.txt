Initially you have to mention an array to compute the problem which is to find the water trapped between in the block size of the element.

for ecample : if there is an array like {1,4,2,6,9}

						[]
						[]
						[]
 					      [][]
					      [][]
					  []  [][]
					  []  [][]
					  [][][][]
					[][][][][]

The array can be formed like blocks like above.
So the water can only be trapped between 4,2.
So the water trapped will be of 2 units.
